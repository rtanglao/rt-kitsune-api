1223249,1530044149,comment récupérer une partie de ses marques pages supprimés.,"<p>bonjour à tous;
</p><pre>je travaille avec quantum 60.0.2 (64 bits) ; win7;
</pre>
<p>PROBLÈME: j'ai 5000 Marques Pages
Lorsque j'avais 4800 M.P. il y a quelques jours j'ai supprimé un sous/sous/sous/dossier qui en contenait une centaine. je dispose en format Json de la sauv. totale automatique des M.P. avant cette suppression intempestive. 
Je ne peux l'importer car je ne souhaite pas écraser mes 5000 par seulement 4800 M.P.
</p><p>LES 2 SOLUTIONS auxquelles j'ai pensé:
</p><p>1°) Compliquée : J'ai donc songé à créer un second profil et importer la sauv. contenant le dossier supprimé.
Sera t'il possible sur un seul ordi? (ou bien plusieurs, si nécessaire) d'ouvrir les deux profils simultanément et copier un par un les liens afin de reconstruire mon dossier supprimé au sein des 5000 M.P. actuel ?
</p><p>2°) Plus simple : Sauvegarder les 5000 M.P. (afin de les utiliser en cours d'opé.) 
Importer MES 4800 comportant le dossier supprimé.
Supprimer sur cet ordi. tous les M.P. sauf le dossier qui me manque.
Créer une Sauv. des M.P. au format HTML.
Importer ma sauv. réalisée en commençant des 5000M.P. actuel.
Importer au format HTML la sauv. du dossier seul (initialement supprimé) réalisée ci-dessus. Il s'ajoutera dans le ""Menu des Marques Pages"" 3°) Sauvegarder les 5000 M.P. (afin de les utiliser en cours d'opé.) 
Importer MES 4800 comportant le dossier supprimé.
Voyez-vous une façon plus simple de procéder ?
</p><p>Je ne comprends pas que quantum n'intègre pas une fonction comparable à l'importation des sauv. natives d'un autre navigateur qui permettrait d'importer des M.P. dans un dossier que nous choisirions.
</p><p>J'indique mes solutions afin d'aider ceux qui cherche avec un outil en français et ne trouvent rien comme moi auparavant.
</p><p>Merci par avance de votre aide. (s'il y a mieux que ma seconde proposition)

(Booting from Flash Drive),"<p>I am currently experiencing problems using Firefox 42.0 on a customised Ubuntu Linux platform. The issue I am experiencing involves Firefox crashing, usually when I try to open a new page. 
</p><p>The issue is intermittent, and a temporary fix can be achieved, by restarting the OS, however, this doesn’t last more than an hour if that. The OS isn’t run from the computer hard drive, but from a flash drive provided by the company I am contracting for, as this is their policy.  
</p><p>Unfortunately, I am unable to make any changes/upgrades to the OS or browser, due to the way it is configured. 
</p><p>The technical support agent at the company I work for, has advised me that the crash is caused because by upload speed is only 0.96 Mbps, where it should be 1 Mbps. Additionally, they also advised the consistency of service for my ISP is 52% and needs to be higher. 
</p><p>My ISP has run tests on my internet connection and believe everything is working as it should be. Could the upload speed and consistency of service, cause Firefox to crash, or is it likely to be another issue?

1223341,1530047700,"after installing ff 61-x64, ff auto update changed desktop icon to x32 version 57.","<p>Automatic updates are turned off in my Firefox installation.    Today, I updated v56.0 x32 to v61.0 x64 via a full download and install.  Since I noted that the help|about menu wanted to update to v57, and v61 was available, I elected to do the full .exe download and install of v61 instead.    I selected the install option to install the background updater feature (I forget what exactly it was called), figuring that it wouldn't be active  as long as I had updates turned off in the general options.  I chose to accept the default of having icons on the desktop, shortcuts, etc.   Once the install was complete, I started v61 normally.  
</p><p>A few minutes after the successful install, I received another firefox installer UAC blank screen request for permission to update, which I approved, since I figured there were last-minute updates to v61.    The next time I started Firefox, I got version 57 per help|about, and a warning that it was out of date.   Although this version is x64, it is running in ""Program Files (x32)"" while the v61 is running in ""Program Files.""   The unexpected install of v57 down-leveled all my icons and shortcuts to point to the v57 version.   If I hadn't had the benefit of multiple firewall warnings, and known how to interpret what I was seeing, this could have been quite unpleasant.  As it is, an easy upgrade has now taken most of the afternoon.  
</p><p>Apparently what happened is that the x32 version was not deleted and  after the installer was active, it decided that the v56.0 version needed to be updated too.  If I did not have my firewall running with program controls on Firefox per .exe location, it would have been much more difficult to realize what was going on.  I'm still a little murky on how the second upgrade got kicked off, but I imagine it'll be clearer to someone who knows the internals.
</p><p>Suggested solutions:
</p><p>(1) When an x64 version is installed, the users should be prompted for disposition of the older x32 version.   Deleting of the prior version is the normal action when updating, so there should be an option to treat the upgrade to x64 the same way.
</p><p>(2) Installer should not down-level shortcuts (in my case from v61 to v57), at least not without getting user permission.
</p><p>(3) ALL facilities should honor the update settings in the firefox options.  Whatever did this update ignored the settings that I have verified in both versions to be set to ""Never Check for Updates.""    Part of this was my fault; at first I thought that the x61 version had some last minute updates needed so I told clicked to allow.
</p><p>(4) Once an instance is started, Firefox always uses that version when a shortcut is used, even if the shortcut points to a different version.  For example, if v61 is already running, and I click one of my shortcuts, a new v61 window is started.  If nothing is running when I click the same shortcut, v57 starts.  This behavior may cause additional confusion in an already murky situation.  The shortcut should either start the version it points to or issue a message that it can't be started until the other version is quit.
</p><p>(5) It appears that the ""Mozilla Maintenance Service"" is installed under the program files x32 folder, and there is a maintenance service installer log from today.  There is no maintenance service folder under program files, even though I think this is probably what I asked to have it installed.  I don't see any warning in the v61 firefox install log that installation was bypassed.   Again, it seems to me that such convolution is ripe for future issues, and the maintenance service should have been installed with v61, or at least a warning issued if that would be too complicated and it needed to be left in the program files x32 folder.  
</p><p>I believe that implementation of these suggestions would help prevent a number of similar sounding problems I have seen reported.
</p><p>I do have three related questions:
</p><p>(a) The background silent update installer that is an option during the v61 install - what does it do and will it honor ""Never Check for Updates?""  If not, how do I disable it?
</p><p>(b) What does the Tools|Options|General option ""Use background service to install updates"" do?  Does that need to be un-checked to disable silent updates, or will the ""Never Check for Updates"" option prevent its activation until I manually select an update? 
</p><p>(c) How do I get rid of the v57 version without also loosing the installer service and without having to delete both versions and loose my config?  
</p><p>If anyone is concerned about my use of the ""Never Check for Updates"" option please rest assured that I have years as a security professional and I have good reason for selecting this option.  Appropriate controls are in place.
</p><p>Thanks for your help.  It is appreciated.

I wanted it like it was. I then discovered that there was a new pref in about:config browser.newtabpage.activity-stream.enableWideLayout, set to true by default, and setting it to false returned me to the 6 sites per row as previously and which I liked and wanted.
</p><p>Today the update to FF61 happened, and the 8 sites per row were back. I thought that maybe the browser.newtabpage.activity-stream.enableWideLayout pref had been set back to true by the upgrade, but it hadn't been - it was and still is set to false. So why have I got 8 sites per row again, and how do i go back to 6 per row?

</p><p>I set YT to be in dark mode and region United States. And from time to time, random time, it somehow loses settings and reverts back to white mode and region Serbia. Even when I'm using FF, or even when I close FF and open it again. It doesn't matter.
</p><p>Note: I tried before, when YT changed it's UI and FF quantum was iin previous versions, to delete cookies.sqlite so that new cookies would be recreated. But that didn't helped.
</p><p>So I decided to see what is wrong with cookies.sqlite with DB brower for sqlite.
</p><p>Searched under host column for youtube and I got this line (image attached) that is a bit weird.
</p><p>Under value column there is a date 2017/10/22 (I don't know what 09-0 is). So I changed value to YES+US.en+20180605-09-0 wrote changes, copied back to profile folder and for now it is working.
</p><p>Will get back if it doesn't.

All ust to move to Win 7 or Win 10 which gets me not one bit better improvement in my studio.  All my SCSI devices would fail to perform as well as they do under XP and have terrible latency issues.

If I open a tab on a livestream and start to navigate someplace else in another tab, the stream will start lagging massively. I can replicate the problem without difficulties: If I open two livestreams basically, the first will completely freeze as soon as I give the focus to the second, but if I focus an empty tab or static webpage it will come back right away, as if the first tab was so low on priority that it simply wasn't updated any longer. 
</p><p>My internet connection is clearly not a problem here (1 Gbps fiber optic, and I experience no such issues when opening even a dozen streams on Chromium) I have also tried doing the same after disabling all extensions but the problem persisted.

Also this morning,suddenly Gmail is now getting the 'no secure connection' message,the only way around that is to turn off the 'Enable HTTPS scanning' option in Avast [which isn't a good option,it's supposed to be an added security risk without that enabled] Every other website is fine,it's only Gmail getting this.

</p><p>It seems to be mostly Google sites. Searching from the address bar in particular has a 100% failure rate.

</p><p>Troubleshooting info provided.
</p><p>As per the other threads that I read involving suggestions:
</p><p>It is *ONLY* happening with Firefox. Tested with Chrome, and Lord help me, even Edge.
</p><p>Firefox is not running a proxy
</p><p>Safe mode did not rectify the issue
</p><p>Avast was disabled, did not rectify the issue (Avast is the only security software outside of Defender)

</p><p>Hi. I am developing an intranet application. We have an old asp web forms site with lots of small js and css files and also a modern part written on angular with several large resource files. 
And recently I encountered a problem with slow page opening for one of the clients that has a slow internet connection. Looks like Firefox 58 (we cannot upgrade immediately due to security concerns) stops using some cached resources and starts requesting them from the server. If I clear all cached files for several minutes everything is good, all files are reported as 304 and are taken from cache and page loads in several seconds. We have cache control headers set to Public, Expired in 2024 and MaxAge 30 days. But 5 minutes later the picture changes - several files begin to be requested each time without etag header and modified date resulting a full download. I tried increasing cache size to 1GB, adding immutable to max age but none of that changed the behavior. I can see all the files in about:cache but stil Firefox doesn't use them.
Is the any way to diagnose the problem or any known solution?

1223590,1530184820,Sometimes static resource files stop beeing cached despite cache control headers,"<p>Hi. I am developing an intranet application. An recently we encountered a very slow page opening at one of our clients in a remote location with slow internet access. The problem seems to be related to that some files stop been cached despite cache control headers. We are using Firefox 58 and cannot quickly upgrade to a newer version due to security concerns. 
When I clear browser cache everything is good. We have cache control headers set to Public, Expired in 2024 and MaxAge for 30 days. All js and css files are reported 304, taken from cache and page loads within several seconds. But several minutes later some files begin to be downloaded again with each page refresh. We have and an old asp web forms app with lots of small js and css resources as well a new part that is rewritten with angular and assembled in a few large minified files. The problem happens to a random set of those and due to slow connection load time increases dramatically. I can see all the files on about:cache page but nevertheless they are requested without Etag match or Last modified date and so server responses with full content. 
I tried to increase cache size up to 1GB without smart managing, adding immutable to max age. But nothing changes the behavior.
Is there any way to diagnose the problem or any known solution?

Then, I can either move the mouse and click on the second field or press &lt;TAB&gt; to get to it.

1223721,1530248426,Where did my passwords go?????!!!!!!!,"<p>HELP!!
</p><p>I have been saving my passwords in firefox for YEARS...I'm talking more than 10 years.
Then firefox came out with this ""sync"" feature...at first, I didn't want to have firefox on my mobile phone as I use safari for everything on my phone.  When xmarks announced it was no longer operating it's service for bookmarks, I decided to get a firefox account.  So I signed up.  I still did not put firefox on my phone.  Firefox emailed me a couple times to inform me that if I did not use firefox sync on more than one device it wouldn't save my bookmarks.  I ignored this email a couple times and finally last week I had time so I downloaded it onto my phone and signed into my firefox account.  NOW, here's what I did not know, that was not pointed out to me very well.  The sync for passwords or ""logins"" is not automatically checked.  Tonight, I have gone to access my logins, and have discovered that they are ALL GONE!!!!  I went and looked at what was there, and it's only things from the day that I synced with my phone.
</p><p>PLEASE HELP!!!!!  I need my passwords!!!!  How can I recover them from my computer??

Until the day came where Chrome stopped supporting Unity, Chrome lost interest to me that day. I was told Firefox still supported unity, and when I tested it that proved true. So I began using Firefox more than Chrome, after getting my Windows 10 I forgot Unity existed. I installed Opera and I loved it, as it stands Opera is one of THE BEST browsers available. Nowadays it's proven that If you don't use Chrome or Opera, you're using a terrible browser. NO OTHER BROWSER is as useful as those two, Firefox was useful because it ran Unity. But now it doesn't appear that Firefox does, making it as useless as Internet explorer. I was told that Firefox 45 should still run Unity, so I went to try and download it(from the official site). But when installing it simply installed the most recent version that I couldn't care less for, this is upsetting and If Firefox will no longer support Unity I will NEVER use it again. Edge and Internet Explorer exist so it's not like i'm desperate for another browser, besides Chrome and Opera do almost everything I could ever need a browser to do...

For example, I go to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox</a>, scroll down to ""See also"", click ""Mozilla Prism"" link there, and then the Firefox' back button; I land at the beginning of the Firefox article instead of the place I was last, i.e. around ""See also"".
</p><p>Reading long articles and navigating back and forth to references is currently not possible, unless I open every link in new tab/window without leaving the original page.
</p><p>Chrome and Vivaldi don't exhibit such behavior, going back in history brings me to the vertical scroll position of where I left. I also *think* in old Firefox the behavior was consistent with Chrome.
</p><p>BTW, navigation with URL fragment also doesn't work. If you enter <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox#See_also"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox#See_also</a> into new tab, you are correctly moved to ""See also"" section. From there, click ""XUL Runner"" and going back moves you to the top of the Firefox page, where you never were... Refreshing the page doesn't change that. BUT forced refreshing (Shift+Ctrl+R) with cache skipped moves you correctly to ""See also"" section again.
</p><p>Linux Mint 18.2, Firefox 60.0.2 from Mint repos. I don't see such behavior under Windows (same version, official build), where it works as under Chrome. Is it some setting, or a bug? (Firefox? Mint? Ubuntu? other?)

Cylance is not a top rated engine and that detection is almost certain to be a false positive.
</p><p>The follow engines passed AutoHotkey_1.1.28.00.zip as CLEAN:  
</p><p>Ad-Aware, AegisLab, AhnLab-V3, Alibaba, ALYac, Arcabit, Avast, Avast Mobile, AVG, Avira, AVware, Babable, Baidu, BitDefender, Bkav, CAT-QuickHeal, ClamAV, CMC, Comodo, DrWeb, Emsisoft, ESET-NOD32, F-Prot, Fortinet, GData, Ikarus, Sophos ML, Jiangmin, K7AntiVirus, K7GW, Kaspersky, Kingsoft, Malwarebytes, MAX, McAfee, McAfee-GW-Edition, Microsoft, eScan, NANO-Antivirus, Panda, Qihoo-360, Rising, SUPERAntiSpyware, Symantec, TACHYON, Tencent, TheHacker, TotalDefense, TrendMicro, TrendMicro-HouseCall, VBA32, VIPRE, ViRobot, Webroot, Yandex, Zoner 
</p><p>NOTE: 9 of the these engines are in the top 10 anitvirus/malware engines (UNDERLINED).  All reported that AutHotkey_1.1.28.00.zip is CLEAN.  F-Secure was not run on this file.
</p><p>Google safe browsing claims that this file is INFECTED.
</p><p>Similar analysis of multiple other Google Safe Browsing ""infected"" files from this site show similar CLEAN results when tested by <a href=""http://virustotal.com"" rel=""nofollow"">virustotal.com</a>.  
</p><p>Mozilla should report this issue to Google and demand that Google employ only quality engines to screen files.  Google should employ better quality algorithms to prevent false flagging of files and web sties.  
</p><p>If Firefox is going to block web access to sites and to downloads based upon bad data from Google, then I am going to be forced to switch to another browser.  
</p><p>Mozilla.  Stand up, take action, and provide the quality service you have provided IN THE PAST.
</p><p>THERE IS A SECOND MAJOR ISSUE.  
Once a download file is flagged as containing malware there is a bug in Firefox.  The only options offered by Firefox are ""REMOVE FILE"" or ""OPEN"".  ""OPEN"" should not be an option at this point.  The options should be ""DOWNLOAD ANYWAY"" or ""REMOVE FILE"".  With the current options and an .exe file (if downloaded) will be immediately executed resulting in infection if the file is tainted.  With my suggested options, If a user chooses to ""DOWNLOAD ANYWAY"" then Firefox should remind the user the file may be infected and should recommend that the file be scanned by the user's antivirus/malware software before opening.

Currently I am using Firefox 47.0.2 with Windows 7 .... I like it ... BUT ... a couple of important websites don't work real well on that combo anymore (Yahoo Mail and Hotmail) but they do work perfectly on Internet Explorer..... Thus I suspect the issue is because my FF version is too old .... Updating,  as I understand it,  will likely mean loosing my favorite Add-ons and getting used to a new layout/system .... Question:  Need Some Advice .... should I continue with Firefox and suffer thru an Update .... or look for a new browser (Not Chrome nor Microsoft IE or related) and make a serious change ....

</p><p>I am developing a web service using REST API. This REST API is running on port 6443 for HTTPS.
Client is going to be a Single page application running on port 443 for HTTPS on same machine.
The problem I am facing is:
</p><p>While I hit the url say:  <a href=""https://mymachine.com/new_ui"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mymachine.com/new_ui</a>
I get certificate exception for an invalid certificate because I use a self signed one, so <a href=""http://mymachine.com:443"" rel=""nofollow"">mymachine.com:443</a> gets added to server exception. But still requests doen't go to REST API as they are running on <a href=""https://mymachine.com:6443/restservice"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mymachine.com:6443/restservice</a>.
If I manually add <a href=""http://mymachine.com:6443"" rel=""nofollow"">mymachine.com:6443</a> to server exception on firefox it works but it will not be the case in production for customers.
</p><p>Some options that I thought are:
1. Give another pop up and ask to add REST server on port 6443 exception too. 
</p><pre>   But this doesn't look proper as why an end user should accept the cerf for same domain twice.
   Also REST api server port can change. 
</pre>
<p>2. Can we programmatically add exception for domain and both the ports in one shot? Ofcourse with the consent of the user.
3. Use a reverse proxy. But then its going to have memory footprint on our system. Also it will be time consuming.
</p><p>Please suggest some options. How do I deal with it.

</p><p>A bit of an odd one this I think. Have already read all the other threads regarding search problems and pretty sure this isn't the same thing at all.
</p><p>No matter what I type into the URL / search box it first very quickly flashes up with a Google link (which is what I have set in my preferences for Firefox [I'm using the Developer Edition] to use) then it redirects to Yahoo and uses their search instead.
</p><p>I have checked all plugins / extensions in Firefox and there are none installed that would do anything like this.
</p><p>Luckily I was able to halt the browser from performing the redirect so I copied the URL that shows before being redirected to Yahoo.
</p><p>This is the sort of URL that I am getting :
</p><p><a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=dog&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-b-ab"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/search?q=dog&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-b-ab</a>
</p><p>Notice the &amp;client=firefox-b-ab at the end. If I take that off the end of the URL then it searches as it should do with Google however with me not changing the URL (which happens automatically as soon as I type something in to search) then it redirects to Yahoo which leads me to believe that Google is redirecting Firefox based upon the fact that it is Firefox?
</p><p>Why they would do that is utterly beyond me though?
</p><p>Thanks for any help with this as I'd really love to be able to get back to having Google as my default search engine again as soon as possible.
</p><p>Best wishes,

Usually I use first to watch a stream or videos (youtube) and the other to other things. When I switch from stream window to other window, the stream is stopping (like stop buffering) and when I get back stream is immediately starts. There's no problem if I stay within the same firefox window, switching tabs only. Audio is always turn on (I know about stoping media while audio is off and tab is inactive). How to solve this? I couldn't find any setting about this issue.

Since the FF61 update I can no longer delete emails in gmail using the # key in FF while on UK keyboard layout. It also does not work in FF incognito. However, all other common shortcuts work in FF, # does work in Chrome, and if I change to US keyboard layout and press Shift+3 in FF that works.
</p><p>I assume this is just a bug, so I've submitted a bug report too. But if anyone's worked out a solution I'd love to hear it.

I did not have the same problem when viewing videos in Internet Explorer. 
</p><p>I discovered a simple solution. I had sometime back installed another video program called VSL Video. I never used it and had forgotten it was installed. Apparently, VSL Video was trying to run in the background every time I would use Firefox to view YouTube videos. I did not have the problem with Internet Explorer. I uninstalled VSL Video and the duplicate audio problem went away. I hope this helps someone with the same problem.

</p><p>I found an article that explained that the bookmarks are saved in the database file places.sqlite so I used an sqlite editor to search &amp; replace the url in the moz_places table » url field. That part worked great, all these bookmarks in Firefox now have the correct url.
</p><p>But still, whenever I go to a bookmarked place, it still doesn't show the blue star that indicates the page has been bookmarked. 
</p><p>Also, these bookmarks have labels in the library, but these labels are not shown when I select a bookmark in the library, as you can see in the attached screenshot.
</p><p>I guess my search &amp; replace action damaged some internal reference, but I can't find which reference. I have checked every table in the places.sqlite database file, and can't find the table that holds these labels.

1224035,1530465989,Updated  version of Firefox is not compatible with my Windows 10 PC,"<p>Hello.  I have a Windows 10 64-bit PC and have been using Mozilla Firefox as my primary internet browser.  I have made sure that my Firefox is up-to-date under the Options Menu.  I have defragmented and optimized my system.  I use Avast anti-virus and Cleanup Premium and have scanned the system for Malware or Viruses.  The problem is that Firefox does not seem to be compatible with Windows at all.  I get frequent system hangups and stalls with messages displayed across the screen in a yellow bar that reads, ""This web page is slowing down your browser"".  Two choices are given and neither choice ends the hang up:  Stop Script or Wait.  This doesn't just happen on one website.  It happens throughout the day.  If I have been using the computer, then leave the house for a few hours and come back, I come back to a completely locked up screen.  The system gets slower and slower and slower as it is used throughout the day.  Sometimes, my screen turns completely black and wiggling my mouse or hitting a key on the keyboard doesn't wake it up.  I have to do the Control-Alt-Delete thing five or six times to wake it back up and Sign Out and Sign Back In.  Then, all is back to normal for a while.  I have uninstalled and reinstalled Firefox with no improvement.  It doesn't seem to happen with other browsers; however, I have always liked the option of keeping my Toolbar at the top of my screen with Bookmarks where I can alphabetize my bookmarked webpages and stick them in alphabetically-arranged folders, etc.  You can't organize your bookmarks or favorites as well using other browsers.  You get stuck with a non-alphabetical list, stupid stars, etc.  I hate all other options.  It is MUCH MORE efficient this old way.  I would like to keep using Firefox, but this cannot continue.  Is there any other advice that you can offer that I have not tried to stop these stalls and hangups?

1224041,1530469859,removed search engines keep coming back,"<p>Search engines that I removed from my list of one-click search engines (in the Firefox options) reappear after a month or so.  This has happened a couple of times already.  I suspect that the reappearance is triggered by a Firefox update, but am not sure about that.  The search engines that I keep removing and that keep reappearing after a while are
- Bing
- <a href=""http://bol.com"" rel=""nofollow"">bol.com</a>
- <a href=""http://Marktplaats.nl"" rel=""nofollow"">Marktplaats.nl</a>
</p><p>I'm using Firefox on Windows 10 Home, with Dutch regional settings.  I cannot find evidence of having (unwittingly) installed any Windows applications or Firefox extensions or plugins associated with these search engines (except that Bing is a Microsoft product and might be integrated into the operating system).  Neither ""<a href=""http://bol.com"" rel=""nofollow"">bol.com</a>"" nor ""marktplaats"" occur in my Windows registry.
</p><p>What is causing these search engines to keep reappearing?  How can I prevent them from reappearing?  I notice an option in the ""General"" section of Firefox options whose description (translated to English) is ""Update search engines automatically"".  Is that the reason for the unwanted search engines reappearing?  I figured that that option meant ""update the search engines from your list automatically"" and would not install search engines that aren't currently in my list.

</p><p>I am a keyboard junkie - and on my Mac with Firefox the delete shortcut (""#"") does no longer work. It's the ONLY shortcut that stopped working. I can do anything else - I can navigate, move mails, go forward and back, write mails, etc - I just cannot delete any more.
</p><p>If I hit CMD-F and hit ""#"" it appears in the search box. I can enter it in the location bar. I can enter it in the search bar in GMail. I can enter it on any web page, I can use it just as before - it just has absolutely no effect in GMail. It does not work in the old AND the new GMail UI.
</p><p>It works in Chrome, though. But I love Firefox, and I will not switch to Chrome. And it should just work, IMHO ;) . I really don't get it.
</p><p>Things I've tried:
</p>
<ul><li> stopped pretty much ANY running tool
</li><li> restarted firefox with addons disabled
</li><li> cleaned out Firefox (shift-CMD-backspace, select ""All"", go)
</li></ul>
<p>Nothing helped.
</p><p>Does anybody have *any* idea why? This severely impacts my GMail productivity ...

On my desktop, if I use the Google Chrome browser, I also do not have a problem opening my e-mail.
This as you might understand is infuriating when you have to re-set the tab every time.
Can SOMEBODY come up with a theory, or even a WILD GUESS as to what might be happening, and let me know??

Until before firefox was updated to v61.0, I had set the browser.tabs.restorebutton=1 under about:config.
This created a ""Restore Previous Session"" button in the top of the FF window.
It does not work anymore with FF 61.0.

The Preference Name browser.tabs.restorebutton still exists under about:config but it just seems to be useless in 61.0.
