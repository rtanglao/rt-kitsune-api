1201200,1516710307,How does one set the default encoding to Unicode (UTF-8) in Firefox?,"<p>To simply rephrase the title, how does one set the fallback text encoding to UTF-8 in Firefox?
</p><p>Before you rush with an answer, please take a moment to consider what the question <strong>really</strong> is about. I have noticed this question being asked multiple times. Each time it's eventually not answered because, invariably, someone deflects the thread with an answer that does not directly address the concern, probably because the author of the reply misunderstood the question. It's usually not a wrong answer, it's just an answer to some other question maybe related to this one. So please, if you cannot provide a direct answer, let the question stick out so that someone realizes that in 2018 Firefox still has this problem. It's not a huge issue, it's more of an annoyance, one that should be easy to fix, but first someone has pick up on the nuances between the need of the end user and the project's UX goals. It's especially important because it does not make sense that a modern browser would only accept legacy encodings as default. It thus sorely looks like an oversight.
</p><p>First, a definition. A <strong>user selected</strong> default text encoding as it is understood here is a <strong>valid</strong> encoding picked by the end user as the one that Firefox should revert to, after all its attempt at automatically detecting a document's encoding have failed. I emphasize on the fact that <em>user selected default</em> effectively means that we're not dealing anymore with <em>automatic detection</em>. It's about what should happen when the latter has completely failed.
</p><p>The only choices currently given when trying to set a fallback text encoding in Firefox are all legacy encodings. I'm running FF 57.0.1 on Ubuntu. You can access the menu from <em>Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Font &amp; Colors &gt; Advanced &gt; Text Encoding For Legacy Content &gt; Fallback Text Encoding</em>. In addition to the legacy encodings present in the list there's also one option that supposedly instructs the browser to rely on the <em>Default For Current Locale</em>,  I'm not sure if what is meant is the machine's locale,  but it certainly doesn't seem to be respected.
</p><p>I have tested this by creating a small text file with a text editor (vim) to which I instructed to encode the text in UTF-8. I then opened it with Firefox and Chrome. Firefox loaded it with the ""Western"" encoding, while Chrome accurately detected the UTF-8 encoding.
</p><p>The screenshot attached below shows the output respectively from Firefox, Chrome, and the locale settings.
</p>
<hr>
<p>Now, as I've mentioned earlier the typical answers to this specific question have been unhelpful. I'm providing here some examples and explain why they're off the mark. At first they seem to address the question, but if you pay attention you realize that they're in fact answering other, maybe related, questions:
</p><p>- <em>Go to View, select Text-Encoding and pick Unicode</em>. This answer is unhelpful because it instructs me on how to manually choose the encoding. What I want is for Firefox to just pick UTF-8 when it can't figure out what to do.
</p><p>- <em>If the document's headers do not specify the encoding then the browser has no way to know what encoding to choose</em>. Exactly, but this question is not about nudging the browser with document headers and meta (automatic detection). It's about instructing it on how to work with documents that have none of that info (user selected default). There's a <em>user selectable</em> list of possible encodings Firefox can fallback to in such situations. I want UTF-8 added to that list. How do I do that?
</p><p>- <em>Normally the http server sends headers to indicate the encoding</em>. Again, when there are no servers, there are no headers. If Firefox is directed to load <em>file:///my/path/myfile.txt</em> and fails to detect what the encoding is, it still has to pick one. At that point, I want it to remember my preference for UTF-8. If there's a way to do this presently it's not clear.
</p><p>- <em>Set the BOM on the file</em>. This is just another way of saying headers, meta, and automatic detection. See my previous points about user selected defaults.

1: When you open two tabs and set them to responsive design, only the first tab will direct to a web page. The second will not.
2: Previously you could paste the dimensions of a resized page into the responsive design, but now you can only paste the first part of the dimensions and then have to manually type in the second. 
3: Previously you could open a second tab and use a keyboard shortcut to resize the window to the same dimension. Now it reverts to some preset screen dimension.
4: When using cntrl+F within the responsive design… well that’s just a whole seething hive of scum and villainy.
5: You cannot type an apostrophe on a webpage form in responsive design. WTF, why? (Actually many keystrokes will shoot the cursive off the page and into some mode I was too livid to take note of.)

1: When you open two tabs and set them to responsive design, only the first tab will direct to a web page. The second will not.
2: Previously you could paste the dimensions of a resized page into the responsive design, but now you can only paste the first part of the dimensions and then have to manually type in the second. 
3: Previously you could open a second tab and use a keyboard shortcut to resize the window to the same dimension. Now it reverts to some preset screen dimension, neither reflecting the other open tab or remembering the previous settings.
4: When using cntrl+F within the responsive design… well that’s just a whole seething hive of scum and villainy.
5: You cannot type an apostrophe on a webpage form in responsive design. WTF, why? (Actually many keystrokes will shoot the cursive off the page and into some mode I was too livid to take note of.) 
</p><p>For the record, I am filled with loathing for this new design and can think of not one benefit it offers other than some designer gets to post it on their resume that they made a change to Mozilla. 
</p><p>Anyway, insane ranting aside, any help that does not involve me having to figure out github would be much appreciated.
</p><p>Thanks in advance.

I am quite aggressive about deleting my cookies and love that option offered in Firefox Tools/Options/Privacy to get rid of them if you want to.  
OK so, I cleared my cash and went to (but didn't sign into) the Chase Bank website, (<a href=""https://chaseonline.chase.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://chaseonline.chase.com/</a>) and I noticed once that there were <a href=""http://Twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter.com</a> and  <a href=""http://Facebook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Facebook.com</a> and <a href=""http://Google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Google.com</a> cookies added.  I thought I didn't clean my cash beforehand so, I cleaned it and went to the Chase website again and, the <a href=""http://Twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter.com</a> and <a href=""http://Facebook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Facebook.com</a> and <a href=""http://Google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Google.com</a> cookies were added along with a few <a href=""http://Chase.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Chase.com</a> cookies.  I called Chase bank about this tonight and they said that they are not adding these cookies.  They only add security cookies AFTER you sign in to identify the computer you are using.  She told me that it is Firefox adding these cookies.  I didn't believe her but, she wouldn't budge on the matter and gave me what she said was a Firefox telephone number to call about this issue.  I called and there was no message saying it had anything to do with Firefox.  Only an option to leave a message so, not knowing who the number belonged to, I didn't leave a message.  I figured I'd ask my question on the forum.  I took a screen shot and uploaded what shows up in the cookies when I go to the website.  
Thanks for your help guys.

Or are we stuck for good with this apple styled layout?,"<p>I left on holiday, to come home to find my Firefox had updated itself to a rather unsightly layout. For years I have used the classic theme restorer to make my browser look aesthetically pleasing. Every time I look up anything involving the new themes, the new layouts, I see the same questions everywhere. People want the old theme back, people want the option to revert back visually to the old style, to put the tabs ""back where they belong on the bottom"" and so on. So I ask, why can't we make that an official option? Why is that request constantly ignored while the visuals keep decaying into the unsightly layout that is reminiscent of school work, utterly devoid of personality. Please, give us options to individually change our layouts back to what they were. Give us better customization to personalize the experience, because sadly, customizing Firefox now feels like pulling teeth, where as over a decade ago it was so easy grade school students had their own personalized browser layouts. So for the question to answer, should anyone involved with Mozilla respond, do you have any plans to ever return to us, the users, the options to change the layout back to how we like it to look, or are we stuck for good dealing with these aesthetically repulsive layouts unless we switch to a new browser?

1201361,1516783262,Select All (Ctrl+A) not working when writing/editing posts on Facebook that have an emote at the very end.,"<p>This is for Firefox Quantum, latest stable update, and I'm on Windows 7 64-bit.
</p><p>Basically while writing/editing certain posts on Facebook (it doesn't happen with all of them), and using shortcuts (Ctrl+A) or right-clicking and pressing Select All, to select all of the post to copy it, it ends up instantly highlighting and unhighlighting the text. The odd thing is it only happens if I put an emote at the very end of the post.
</p><p>One of the only solutions I've found so far (if I don't want to remove the emote at the end) is to use my mouse to select all of the text and copy it that way (cut/copy/paste all seem to work normally). There is however a workaround, typing a single space/character after the emote allows me to highlight the text normally, and if I use a space, it will be removed automatically once the post is saved.
</p><p>I'm loving every other aspect of the browser so far, but just ran across this one bug. I tried restarting the browser, didn't help. Haven't tried rebooting my PC since discovering this bug, but I've done that in the time since installing FF Q (shortened name of this browser). Highlighting text does work outside of when I'm writing/editing posts on Facebook with an emote at the very end. Ctrl+A does work on Facebook when writing/editing posts without emotes at the very end.
</p><p>Highlighting text also works when writing a comment on YouTube for comparison. Highlighting text works properly when editing any post (including with an emote at the very end) on Facebook when using Chrome and Cent Browser from my testing so far (I've used both browsers for years and never had this problem).

</p><p>Unfortunately, currently I am forced to play all those io games on google chrome, because when the games are played in full screen on firfox, everytime the mouse goes towards the top of the screen, the address bar pops out, causing me to accidentally misclick a book mark, another tab, or to accidentally close another tab. Which is not an issue that occurs in chrome and therefore I am forced to use chrome.
</p><p>All i request is simply, please add an option somewhere in firefox, which allows us, the user to choose, whether we want the address bar popping out in full screen mode of firefox. 
</p><p>If the dev is reading, I also have a better suggestion, make it so that, the address window can pop out when F6 is pressed instead of mouse hovering to the top, because, the current way you are handling it, leads to alot of accidental misclicks on the address bar in full screen.

</p><p>As you may have guessed, this certificate is for a Confluence installation.
</p><p>I've next used a Group Policy Object to deploy this certificate to every computer in our domain.

However, computers accessing this local Confluence website from Firefox (currently, version 57) give error:

Specifically, there are some other internal websites that I didn't set up, but that we also distribute certificates for via Group Policy Objects.

Now every download gets dumped in the standard download folder or if I want it to be put in a dedicated folder I have to go there and chose that folder over and over and over again..

After some more updates it still does not work as I was used to.

I have tried different settings like ""always ask me"" but it keeps starting from the standard download folder.
</p><p>Is there some thing that can make this work again like it used to ? 
Like a setting  in about:config or with some addon ?

I just think it should be against the law for a company to force its will on those who use their products, as firefox has been doing,
for the longest, with their browser by automatically updating one's personal computer, though that individual, specifically requested, that updates are not desired, as given the option, by firefox, to choose that preference.
</p><pre>I believe it could be considered a breach of a verbal contract between the user and the provider of a service. If programs can be forced, at will, onto an individual's computer by one company, then why not allow every company to force what ever programs they desire onto everyone's personal computer with no choice to refuse? Imagine how that would look, if every company was given the same privilege as is afforded to firefox.

</pre>
<p>I just think firefox is committing a cyber crime that needs to be brought to the attention of regulators, especially when a forced program causes other desired programs to malfunction. This is morally, as well as, socially wrong, to deny individuals the use of what they rely on, because one company want to play the cyber bully by forcing it's will on others, and ignoring any plea for mercy. 
The firefox bully has gotten too big for it's own good, and need to be put in check.

1201485,1516817887,Any way to combine title- and menu bars without breaking the double-click new-tab feature of tab bar?,"<p>Dear volunteers, I started using the classic theme restorer addon when the ""make firefox fancy again""-guys were bothering my FF experience too bad with australis.. however as almost every (for myself useful) addon has been killed out of firefox recently this won't work anymore so I need to find other ways. What I could figure out so far is how to move down the tab bar again, with some weird css stuff and how to mostly restore my toolbar look and feel. However I am now stuck with this issue, which is pretty annoying as I am not able to adapt to such behavioral changes too good...
In older versions I combined the menu bar with my title bar, just as is the case right now in quantum (menu bar items and window buttons on the same bar/line). However I am also (often!) double clicking the tab bar to open a new tab, which is now broken, as long as you hide the real title bar. When enabling the title bar, the window buttons switch to this bar and the menu buttons have their own one, plus the tab bar is double clickable to open a new tab. I am very comfortable with hiding the title bar but in that case double clicking the tab bar will max-/minimize or drag the firefox window, instead of just opening a new tab, which is the main point, I need to fix for me...
Obviously since quantum everything bar-like belongs to some ""title-bar-without-title""-blob, which should be changed or at least be customizable either way (just like the tabsontop-&gt;false about:config setting should just be (?re-)added again, if blocking such useful addons remains strategic).
</p><p>Did I miss any option here to customize the new ui or is there any (still working) addon for it, I could not find?
</p><p>&gt;Edit: Found this other question which is somehow equal but I'd like to know if there is some way to independently combine the two bars without impacting the tab bars behavior..

</p><p>Unless I'm mistaken, these are the only options, and their associated problems:
</p><p>1. layout.css.devPixelsPerPx - changes UI along with web pages
2. Add-ons - don't work properly all the time - sometimes the fonts come out funny and the page layout changes (very different from using the native zoom if you compare side by side)
</p><p>Since there's already the ability to change the zoom level of a page, why can't a different default be set? There were only two things keeping me from switching from Chrome to Firefox - changing the default zoom, and enabling ""highlight all"" always for searching text (which is now available - yay). Come on, how hard can it be???

</p><p>there is a huge problem with Firefox 58.0 version.
</p><p>When I copy a table from a website into another, the table is copied in the wrong way, because everything is in one single row. All the columns are merged together and they are not taken into consideration.
</p><p>The software used in the website I have the problem is Discuz!, but I guess the problem also appears with other softwares.
</p><p>Attached is the comparison of right (up to Firefox 57.0.4) and wrong (Firefox 58.0)

1201712,1516900213,[Firefox Quantum] Rendering bug when scrolling in portrait,"<p>Using Firefox 57/58, when scrolling long pages in portrait orientation (such as on a Surface Pro tablet), black/white horizontal bars will appear midway down the page (see screenshot). I have tested this on a completely fresh install of Firefox 58 (with default settings and no addons) and the bug still occurs.
</p><p>The bars will appear at random locations, and once rendered will scroll with the page, blocking out a section of content. Refreshing the viewport (eg. by switching the tab to another and back) will clear the bar, but new bars may appears once the content is scrolled again.
</p><p>This error does not occur in landscape mode or for short pages (whose length does not exceed the vertical screen resolution), so I suspect this bug is related to how Firefox pre-renders the content (outside of the current viewport) while scrolling.

Bookmarks there, the history, the usual stuff.  (I had a laptop upgrade a day or so ago and everything was perfect on it afterwards.   Not a burp.)  Well this morning I came in and started up the machine and began the usual daily routine.  I pulled up the bookmarks and they were gone.  I checked the history and it was also gone.  Now the version of firefox I am on is Firefox ESR.  I looked at the download history and it said that the download failed.  Same error for days.  Now when I check the download history that I downloaded it is gone.  I have read quite a bit on the support faq's and still haven't found anything that has helped.   When I tried the backup bookmark files it said it couldn't be recovered.  For some reason this ESR version doesn't seem familiar, is there a way to tell what version was before the upgrade last night and can that recovered?  It probably was the ESR I just didn't notice or remember.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

</p><p>This problem with proxy authentification isn't new and we lived with it for at least the past year or so. Because we get so many support requests about this (I am from the IT department), we have now decided to investigate some more.
</p><p>So to use our ""pac"" proxy, students have to configure their OS network settings with ""Automatic proxy settings"" using our proxy address. We set Firefox to use system proxy settings (problem occur with Firefox own proxy settings too).
</p><p>Some users don't get the proxy authentication window on websites they are suppose to. To those, we guide them to set ""network.automatic-ntlm-auth.allow-proxies"" to ""False"" under the ""about:config"" menu. Then the authentication window comes up as it should (Windows not trying to pass credentials first). Thing is, it's a pain for our IT department to guide many Firefox users through this process and although we have online documentations that mention the extra steps, many students struggle with the process.
</p><p>Today, we found more informations about the problem. It appears that users that have this issue are using ""Microsoft account"" type of login on their machine. If we change their accounts from Microsoft accounts to simple local accounts on their machines, then the proxy authentication window comes up correctly, without changing any Firefox setting (""network.automatic-ntlm-auth.allow-proxies"" still to True)
</p><p>This problem is easily reproduced switch between Microsoft account login to simple local account and vice-versa.
</p><p>We have done our tests with Windows 10 machines running Firefox 64-bit (version 58.0) and we haven't tested yet if the problem occur with other versions of Windows or Firefox 32-bit. It doesn't seems to matter on what network the machine is connected to.
</p><p>Other browsers never have issues getting the proxy authentication window to show up, no matter if using a Microsoft account or local account. Also no need to change any settings.
</p><p>Is this a known Firefox bug ? Can this problem be brought to Mozilla developpers ? Is there an easier workaround ?
</p><p>Thank you very much in advance !

1201750,1516910574,Firefox won't go to websites,"<p>Firefox updated recently, and I thought there were no problems.  As of yesterday, when I open Firefox it goes to a blank tab and looks as if it is running.  If I put an address into the address bar, nothing.  If I click on one of my bookmarks, nothing.  I even uninstalled the program and re-installed and it still does the same thing.  Not having these issues with other browsers.  I can survive without Firefox, but I'd prefer not to.  This and Chrome give me two good options to avoid using Internet Explorer as much as possible!  I am running Windows 7 Professional.  Any help would be appreciated.

This Problem bothers ca. 90% of our Clients. When you try to start the Firefox Application, Windows acts like trying to load but doesn't succeed and nothing happens ever after. When you take a look at the Task Manager, it has open one Firefox Process. A ""closer look""
to the Performance Monitor of Windows shows, that this Process hat 3 Threads started. but doesn't use any CPU or RAM. On a Client, where the update succeded, we have like 6 started Processes with round about 150-200 Threads. If we uninstall the Firefox and install the previous version 57.0.4, it works just fine, for as long as the update doesn't happen.
Meanwhile we tried to delete everything of a faulty version that we could find, including reg keys, profiles etc. and do a clean install.
We tried to start Profile Manager, Firefox in Safe Mode, but none of it worked.
The only thing that worked, is to start the OS in Safe Mode and open Firefox. In there it worked just fine.
We are using Windows 7 with the latest Service Packs and Hotfixes/Updates and the latest drivers possible.

</p><p>Hope someone can help, running Firefox 57.0.4 32bit and we are having a strange issue where Firefox refuses to start but unresponsive process consumes a lot of CPU.
The problem appears to be with the Startup Cache or ""fastcache"" as if the following file is removed Firefox is then able to start:
</p><p>""C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\PROFILENAME\startupCache\startupCache.4.little""
</p><p>Firefox then creates another file on exit, but after some time the issue returns and we have to again remove the ""startupCache.4.little"" file.
One workaround that does work is to start Firefox with the -purgecaches switch which clears the cache on startup (including the startupCache.4.little file)
I am able to reproduce the issue by copying the startupCache.4.little from a profile with the issue.
</p><p>Not sure what is actually causing the problem with the file all we know is that removing the file fixes the problem.
Any insight on this would be appreciated or/and does anyone know if there is a away of debugging Firefox to see what is actually happening or any ideas?

Two, I know it's not a V58 issue because before I updated, I downloaded a portable version of Firefox V58 to test it out and changing that value to false made the tabs open on the end every time without fail. I'm sure a full uninstall and clean install would fix the issue but I really would like to make that a last resort since there is no more FEBE for this version and because of that, redoing all the settings and add-ons and the settings in the add-ons is a real pain.

</p><p>Steps to reproduce:
</p><pre>- open a lot of tabs
- Firefox has been crashed (well, I had to use `kill -15 PID' actually, since it has been frozen first)
- note that sessionstore.jsonlz4 doesn't exist anymore in profile directory, so current session has been wiped away completely
- start Firefox
- see a new clean session and note, that ""..."" menu &gt; ""Restore Previous Session"" is grayed out
- close Firefox
- find the latest (by time) session backup file in your profile directory: mine is sessionstore-backups/recovery.jsonlz4
- use it as a new current session file (e.g., shell command from profile directory): cp sessionstore-backups/recovery.jsonlz4  sessionstore.jsonlz4
- start Firefox again
</pre>
<p>What should happen:
</p><pre>- Firefox should restore session from a ""new"" sessionstore.jsonlz4 backup file OR make ""Restore Previous Session"" option is available
</pre>
<p>What happens:
</p><pre>- clean session again
- ""Restore Previous Session"" is not available
- try another session backup files: same results
</pre>
<p>What am I doing wrong?
</p><p>Thanks in advance.

Yes, I know that I can use <a href=""https://www.jeffersonscher.com/res/scrounger.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.jeffersonscher.com/res/scrounger.html</a> * to get links from session file and manually restore my session, but shouldn't Firefox do it automagically for me?

I hate Google (and Apple too), so this is not an ideal situation, but this Firefox SCREW UP is the end of the line for me unless Firefox is FIXED.

EVERY SITE, beginning with Google, Facebook, my Financial Institutions, and all the way down the line are supposedly ""set up wrong"" according to this latest Firefox. This is a deplorable thing to say about ALL the sites that Firefox has loaded just fine since the beginning until NOW.
</p><p>Honestly, unless this is some kind of joke, or unless there is a SIMPLE fix to this global problem, I will sadly be saying ""good-bye"" to Firefox.  :-(  This makes me feel SAD, as I have been a loyal user since the OLD days.

After this, it starts in on the ""inner workings"" of the browser YOU PEOPLE just released, which FAILS TO WORK. To be honest, this does not inspire confidence in Mozilla.  :-(
</p><p>If you have a simple solution to this, please send it to me or outline it in simple terms. Otherwise, I'm a Chrome or other browser user from now on.

With guidance from Kaspersly Lab, I have uninstalled Kaspersky Intnernet Security and re-installed it, I had already uninstalled Firefox, so downloaded and installed it .  And still the same problem: Every site, e.g. Amazon, is stated as insecure with the same error message:
Error code: SEC_ERROR_UNKNOWN_ISSUER
I have refreshed the Troubleshooting Information in the box below.

This has worked fine in all versions prior to FF58, after updating to 58, my bookmarks toolbar has gone missing, I get a message that FF lost my sessions, it can't retain window size (opens windowed instead of maximized)...
</p><p>I have tried to move the folder to another network share, but that yields the same result (problem). Having it local gives no issues.
</p><p>From my own investigation, it seems that FF58 is having problems renaming some files in the profile folder, the console log tells me this, due to locked because another process is using it (no, only FF). These files are almost the same files every time and they end up having a .tmp extension. If I manually fix these files, FF is back to normal - for that one session.
</p><p>What could be the reason for FF58 behaving like this? Is it exiting before the renaming of the files are completed, leaving the job halfdone?
</p><p>I am running FF58, (x64), Win 7 (x64).
</p><p>I would appreciate some help in resolving this issue.

I am shouting sorry as I can barely see. My eyes are smarting and tearing and I can hardly read the tabs, the contrast between the dark tab and the name of the tab in a sort of muted white or grey makes the print difficult to read -- and any red fades out (as is natural in the dark, it's physics). So the screen is extremely bright, like white light, and the tabs are extremely dark, the letters obscured, any red logos tend to be muted into the dark, and I have a sudden splitting headache.  I was fine with the previous Firefox.  I just checked Safari  -- I'm fine.  I think this is a health issue.

1202086,1517072777,waste of Photon UI space,"<p>I really admire the way that Firefox developers have designed a much lighter browser for desktop PCs etc, certainly RAM-friendly and allows users more control to customize preferences.  However, not at all keen on new Photon UI (user Interface) that replaced the Australis one, that at least had a personalized feel and never left a gaping-empty-page-abyss below URL bar.   This has nothing at all to do with empty space on either side of the URL bar - below it is where blank white ocean rules, no matter what ADD-ON extensions to bring life to the above-URL. 
</p><p>The former Firefox UI logo spread purposefully user-friendly accross the blank white ocean as confirmation that indeed, Firefox was your trusted brand of browser banner/ISP.  Now, it only exists as a URL bar which means you get a wasteful use of UI space; URL extensions merely complimentary to the subject header with no content below it.  For instance, the image uploaded demonstrates my point precisely, except that I have removed the toolbar features such as YT, FB, Amazon, Twitter etc as never use them - why can't Firefox personalize again, the much missed Australis one (large Fox Icon), or something similiar, to fill the gaping-empty-page-abyss (located) below URL bar?.

</p><p>I'm NOT good on computers at all, so please be gentle with me.
</p><p>I kept getting messages wanting me to upgrade Firefox to Version 58.  I didn't want to at first because the version I had was working fine and 'if it aint broke, why fix it!'  Then my version stopped playing streaming video and I didn't know why.  It still played 'stored' video, I suppose you'd call it, like MOST YouTube video clips (or Vimeo or anything else like that) but it had BIG problems with free movie site links (showed initial video picture but couldn't click on the start arrowhead) and all streaming video (came up with error messages saying 'MIME support not found', stuff like that, I don't know what MIME support is, sorry.) 
</p><p>So I thought I'd install the latest version and see if I could watch streaming video without having to use Chrome, which I don't like, it slows my admittedly aging computer down to a crawl. (I know Firefox still has the memory hogging problem but it's always had that, always WILL have that, I can live with that!)  I've downloaded it. It won't install. I click on the installer and it starts doing something but 45 minutes later still nothing's happened. I've tried uninstalling the Firefox I had - I'm using Chrome ATM - and then installng version 58, same thing, it starts doing something but 45 minutes - 60 - 90 minutes later still nothing's happened.  No error messages, just flashy hard drive but nothing really going on.  
</p><p>I'm using XP SP3 on a Foxcon 1 Motherboard (how apt!) and I've got nearly 2T of hard drive spare and 6gig of RAM - I'm getting all this off the specs list that came with the computer, I'm not claiming I understand what I'm saying right now, I'm bad at computers - but I'm clinging onto the fact I DO understand XP pretty well and all my software runs on it, nothing I've got likes 7 or any of the other versions.  (It SAYS it does but all my music software is Glitch Central in 7,  even in XP emulation mode,  works beautifully in XP! If it aint broke...) 
</p><p>Why won't Firefox install? And what version will play STREAMING video and video on movie sites (Like Netflix, MovieJagg Pro, Twomovies etc?)

Firefox used to be a great browser but it's become too smart for its own good and is now a complete pain in the neck.

</p><p>Or is no account data for Firefox sync stored in cloud, and is only retrieved from the de-facto device (as a minimum of two are required for a Firefox Sync account to work properly)?  And if not, why not offer cloud-based solutions to store the ciphertext or whatever the chosen format may be for the encrypted account data, so that it may be retrieved without this hassle or cumbersome requirement at times.
</p><p>Although, I could certainly understand the reluctance to harbor such data, even in an encrypted format due to a possible security breach of servers or violation of vulnerabilities in systems.
</p><p>So in a breviter intim atum, my question is:  how is account credential data retained and transmitted from one Firefox sync account to the next (from the primary device or via cloud), and how secure is the data on whatever harddrive (obfuscated v. encrypted?), and yes I do use FIPS-192 protocol and secure my Firefox's with a master password with a bit-strength of greater than 200 in order to secure these logins, so no further additional security measures may be taken or implemented to achieve greater security hitherto; however, I also find that there are plenty of services that could be strengthened consequently.

I found I DID NOT LIKE certain (lack of) features so I deleted Version 58? and went back to 13.0.  BUT....NONE OF MY BOOKMARKS WENT BACK!!!
I'm SCREWED...I have over 1500 major or sub/sub bookmarks!
</p><p>I FOUND THEM under Mozilla/Firefox/profiles/(default#)/bookmarkbackups.  When you finally get to bookmarkbackups you have several date options.  However, they are in JSON files, and when I open in WordPad it shows just continuing text and marks.  BUT...you can read the text and see that the bookmarks ARE STILL IN THE COMPUTER.  I just can't get them back to the regular bookmarks drop-down at the top of the browser page.
</p><p>So...does anyone know how to get the JSON file(s) back over to the bookmark toolbar?

2) Reinstall Firefox (or Windows and then firefox)
3) Choose the backup folder, TO:
4) Continue use of firefox as if reinstall was never performed.
</p><p>But the Firefox process is making this difficult for me. There are two folders that firefox uses: the ""profile"" and the ""cache"" folder. Now, it is only possible to back up the ""profile"" folder. When you reach point (3) above, the built in profile manager (firefox.exe -P) only lets you choose the desired ""profile"" folder location and not the ""cache"". When you finish the setup in the profile manager, as Firefox does not have the ""cache"" folder, it creates ITS CONTENTS inside the backed ""profile"" folder. You have now then, unwillingly, merged the 2 folders in one.
</p><p>Profile Manager must have the option to choose BOTH origin and destination folders for BOTH ""profile"" and ""cache"" folders. So that backing up Firefox experience is more seamless.

</p><p>I checked on Microsoft Edge and it is working just fine, so it is not my Kaspersky that is causing this issue. So this is obviously a Firefox problem. I realized I am using a Beta version, so perhaps this is some functionality that has not made it in. But beyond uninstalling Firefox and installing another version, how do I fix this?

1202428,1517249387,Suggestion: Include webpage icons in Firefox Sync,"<p>I'm especially glad I upgraded from Firefox 57.0.4 stable to Firefox 58.0 stable when I found out yesterday afternoon that addresses are now included in Firefox Sync's capabilities if I tell Firefox Sync to do that, which I did. It would be great if all the webpage icons on my bookmarks would sync with Firefox Sync as well. As of Monday, January 29, 2018, I have 520 bookmarks, all in my bookmarks bar. I'm very much used to recognizing webpages by their respective icons in that list, along with their names. I've had to reset my Inspiron 7558 two days ago for the umpteenth time because of slowness, not to mention Firefox wouldn't open despite uninstalling it and then reinstalling it! Firefox 57.x didn't work out well for me since it's clear to me that version put speed before reliability. It was the first time Firefox called their Windows, macOS and Linux browsers ""Firefox Quantum"", after all. Thankfully, with Firefox 58.0, everything's under control. Hopefully, with Firefox 58.0 and a nice, clean 500 GB hard drive, Firefox won't keep crashing. I would love to get an email response from any of those countless bug reports I've always sent with the Mozilla Crash Reporter! 
</p><p>And another thing, it would be great if ALL the settings in my browser on Windows 10 Redstone 3 synced with Firefox Sync. There are a few as of right now that don't, such as having the taskbar in Windows 10 having one tab per Firefox tab open, not per Firefox window open. This is especially helpful when I'm downloading public domain or free use images from <a href=""http://flickr.com"" rel=""nofollow"">flickr.com</a> or <a href=""http://loc.gov"" rel=""nofollow"">loc.gov</a> for me to back up safely on my OneDrive and then seamlessly have them on all my devices like my iPhone 6s and my services like FreePrints! Right now, Firefox is my preferred browser on both Windows 10 and my 64 GB silver iPhone 6s, and as long as I can notice a major or otherwise demonstrable improvement over the previous major stable build every seven Tuesdays, it shall always be, and I shall highly recommend it to every one of my family members and friends! There's always room for improvement for nearly everything!

So I did clean reset on my computer, removing all the files and left nothing else other than the generic items that came with my Windows 10 Pro. Still when I install Firefox once more, again another deep freeze occurred.
</p><p>Next I did two separate memory diagnosis and the reports conclude that memories are in good shape. As I dig some more on the internet. It seems that people are suffering a triple whammy since my computer is AMD base, my GPU is AMD base with have shown issues with Windows 10. Also I use Firefox extensively for almost a decade; this is the first it may have cause a BSOD. Lastly I discovered that Firefox have been dealing with issues in regards to Windows 10 as well.
</p><p>like I had stated before, this is the first time I am experience such an event. I am at lost here, my computer is telling that hardware are in good shape yet I am afraid of touching Firefox as I am typing this situation now.

Today, 1/29/2018, I had Firefox open and the browser advised me there was a version update (I was using 57.0). I never set my browsers to update automatically!! I always have them advise me of updates and I choose when to update them. So when I had a minute, I updated to the new version, 58.0.1 (64-bit). My system runs Windows 7 professional.
So after I updated to the new version 58.0.1 Firefox Quantum delete ALL MY SAVED PASSWORDS. Why did Firefox do this? What was the reason for deleting all my passwords? My bookmarks and everything else I checked seems to be in place. It's just the passwords. I have never had a version update delete my saved passwords. What is going? Can anyone advise on this?

Mozilla cannot be required to maintain compatibility with third party applications.  But Profile Manager was an integral feature of FF.  I had multiple profiles, with separate and distinct bookmarks and browser add-ons for each.  Now only one remains, and of course, it's the plain vanilla profile without all the customization.  I think you folks could have warned us that installing the latest and greatest version of FF would blow off our extra profiles.  I don't know if that information is still still on my computer and can be recovered, or not.  I'm disappointed, and if I keep using FF, I definitely won't be enabling the auto-update feature again.  And I get to spend time sorting this out that a reasonable warning would have saved me.  Not happy about that.
</p><p>P.S.  Your site still lists the Profile Manager as a solution to providing multiple profiles.  You should update your information to say ""Feature not available with the current FF / v57+""

1202515,1517278683,Please how can i convince Mozilla to ad features so i can update...,"<p>I know this is a weird question... but i see no other place in the forums to post it.
</p><p>Who i can talk to? is Mozilla really a company that listens to ALL its users?.
</p><p>The thing is i like having my Firefox updated... but the problem is... i also like my addon features.
</p><p>I know probably any developer reading this is annoyed by this request... and i don't blame a huge company like Mozilla to ignore someone like me. And i also understand they fact that if they start adding features well... where should they end doing it? where is the END LINE of customer features request.
</p><p>Whatever the case... i just CANT update,  I tried... but i cant live without my features... is just not possible for me i am so used to them. Please help me... what i ask is not really complicated to deliver i think.
</p><p>1) Please let the Navigation Toolbar to ""auto hide"" and when i move the mouse it will appear again !!!, i love having those extra 8% of space in my laptop I NEED THEM !!! i CANT LIVE WITHOUT THEM.
</p><p>2) Please add something to save things in file FLY, i use a ""double right click"" over a picture to save to a folder i set in a menu. So if i right click and chose ""save to desktop\images\2018\January\style"" then i just browse the internet ""double right click"" and is DONE !! saved, then i can change the default folder.
</p><p>3) Please... make it so we can open a tab in a secondary screen, and move things around displays... this sounds like something very had to implement for you people i understand... but can you tell when we have 2 or more displays?, then right click a link ""send to third screen"", also let us set the size and placement of windows in said display please.
</p><p>4) My download manager is not working anymore... and it had a beautiful feature, i pressed ""ctrl + space + o"" and it opened THE LAST FILE DOWNLOADED. You have no idea how intuitive it is to just click a macro an open the last thing you downloaded... i cant believe no browser has thought of adding this natively yet.
</p><p>Please add this... as you can see they are not CRAZY suggestions... i just cant live without them... :( please help me upgrade, i want to update but i cant live without them.
</p><p>Will the big company listen and start working on this?....

1202520,1517282617,HTML5 videos will not playback,"<p>All of a sudden, most of the videos on any site will not playback.  From the Adobe Flash troubleshooting page, it appears that it is the HTML5 videos that will not play.  When I clicked on the test for Non-HTML5 videos, it played back fine.  Watched CBS web site one night, next day, nothing plays.  Same with Youtube, ABC, NBC, yahoo news, cnn, etc.  They all look like they are loading and getting ready to play, but the circle just keeps spinning, and then I get a message that says if playback does not start soon, I should restart my device.  Restarting the device (my PC) does nothing.  I have uninstalled, and reinstalled both Firefox and Flash.  I have also refreshed Firefox.  Nothing works.  And all the videos will play on Edge and Chrome, so I know it has to be something with either Firefox or with Firefox and my PC together.  How do I get videos to play again in Firefox?

1202532,1517289144,Prevent Buggy Automatic Unwanted Javascript Debugging When Page Is Refreshed While Inspecting,"<p>Firefox Developer Edition v59 on Windows 10
</p><p>Inspect Elements opens the DOM and Inspector tab allowing developers to identify a classname for example, go into our IDE, add or edit the CSS properties and refresh the page for review. 
</p><p>Yes, I know we can change CSS in the Developer Tools but that is not efficient nor practical when inspecting and modifying multiple CSS properties for an area in a page when multiple changes that need to be saved and reviewed to determine if the CSS edits made in the IDE are appropriate and work well with the rest of the content in the page that is displayed.
</p><p>As soon as the page is refreshed while the Inspector tab is opened the Javascript Debugging starts and switches to the Javascript Debugger tab and begins debugging the Javascript in the page. THIS IS A BUG that has been BUGGING ME FOR AT LEAST A YEAR.
</p><p>How do we stop the debugger from running on a page refresh when all we want to do is Inspect, modify, refresh and continue Inspecting if wanted? Well designed and tested software does not decide to start and run code on its own and that's what the Developer Tools do when the page is refreshed when Inspecting the DOM.
</p><p>I might add Chrome does not have this bug. When will this bug be resolved or how is it to be worked-around as it is not only annoying it is costly in time to respond to and breaks a developer's concentration to respond to the bug because the developer is compelled to go back and forth to stop unwanted behavior of this browser and restart the intended functionality.

1202534,1517290018,"I keep getting the same error message and nothing will fix it, how do I get it to stop?","<p>I keep getting the error message that my profile was unavailable or inaccessible, however I still had all of my bookmarks and page histories. I followed the forum page that said how to set a new profile, but it still wouldn't fix it. It was just annoying at first, having to close the same error message 3 times before I could ever open a new tab. I just had to uninstall it and reinstall it because I tried to open my desktop app and the error message would not close. I even completely closed the application and it would reopen just to display the same error message. I uninstalled it application and its support system and reinstalled it hoping to fix the problem but it did the same thing. I ended up having to uninstall the application again just to get my computer to function because it was slowing it down so much. I really hope there is a way to resolve this because the schoolwork we have to do only works on your web browser. I would appreciate any help I can get. Also, it may not be related but I couldn't get my Adobe Flash Player to play a video on a website that has been playing them up until now, even after the update.

This is not good enough there are lot of complaints about this - GET IT SORTED
It is the plugin container causing the issues &amp; COM surrogate, when that opens up it prevents editing or deleting images!
All up to date = 58.0.1
No extra plugins or extensions
And what;s with the multiple FF's running?
All the advice you have given other users is rubbish. will you buy us new laptops when you have fried ours?
