<p>This process sends and receives information over the Internet. It runs whenever I open Firefox and, if I close the process with Task Manager, then Firefox closes too. I checked the web site - it is a mystical, spiritual type of website which I am very unlikely to have purposely ever visited. It offers a 15-day free trial of something. Apparently I had trouble with this before because, some time ago, I had already blocked the website in the Windows' Host file. I don't find any related software actually installed on my computer, so I can't simply remove or uninstall it. 
</p><p>I am very uncomfortable allowing a strange site like this to be transferring data from my computer every time I use Firefox. Does anyone know how to stop this process from running?

</p><p>Why do I prefix my keyword searches with the # sign?
</p><p>I know that I'm not going to use the # symbol in my searches, so I use it. However, if I want to search for the g on my default search engine or another keyword, I want to do so. The # sign makes it easier for my to determine what I am doing. It defines my intention.
</p><p>How did I test this?
</p><p>I used my computer at work. Searching using my keywords that are prefixed with the # symbol works just fine.
</p><p>However, on my computer at home it doesn't work.
</p><p>What I've tried to fix the problem.
</p><p>I've uninstalled and reinstalled Firefox.
I've refreshed my Firefox settings.
I've deleted the AppData/Roaming folder from my Window's user, and then uninstalled and reinstalled Firefox.
I've deleted this computer from my Firefox sync list and then reinstalled Firefox.
I've restarted my computer.

This should be possible by just going to &gt;Cookies and site data &gt;Manage permissions and blocking cookies for <a href=""http://facebook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">facebook.com</a> but the problem is this option for firefox is completely useless , doesn't do absolutely anything as I'm still getting cookies saved from <a href=""http://facebook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">facebook.com</a> , therefore every  time I open firefox again my facebook is already logged in.
</p><p>Is there any alternative solutions to this besides checking the box ""Delete cookies and site data when Firefox is closed"" ???
</p><p>Because I don't want that either...cause that means I have to log into every site separately every time I open again firefox...I only want to do that for Firefox.

Just before updating to Firefox 65.0 tonight, I had my dark theme for the title bar and tabs working just right. After updating, Firefox insists on displaying the Windows 10 blue title bar and tabs no matter how many times I try to reset the dark theme again in Add-Ons.
It's only when the Firefox windows loses focus that it displays my dark theme, and when itit regains focus, the theme goes right back to Windows 10 blue.
I am using Windows 10, latest updates, and Firefox 65.0, the new update.

I have asked similar question on a Duckduckgo's subreddit already, and I have received a response saying that it might be an issue with plugins that might be interfering, or Firefox itself.
I cannot control text inside search box of Duckduckgo on Firefox; using shortcuts like Ctrl+A, Ctrl+Shift+Left/Right, Ctrl+Left/Right causes some behaviour or text selection to happen, outside the text box that was active at the time when shortcuts were performed (I have tested with all plugins both disabled and enabled, and with shortcuts turned both on and off in duckduckgo's settings). I am not sure if it is an issue with Firefox itself because same shortcuts seem to work in google search box. On the other hand, I have also tested said shortcuts on both search engines on Chrome, and I didn't encounter such issues.

</p><p>Windows 10 Pro; 64-bit; all updates present; all operations normal and stable... up until the subject event.
</p><p>I was minimizing my browser while working in my eMail client (Thunderbird). Firefox is default, so clicking links from Thunderbird is normally seamless. Came to pass that I clicked, re-clicked and double-clicked a few links - in relatively rapid succession, or what I'd call ""normal browsing"" - trying to determine if the eMail links were bad...
</p><p>When I attempted to maximize Firefox from the taskbar, it would not respond... It took about a moment for me to scratch my head, survey my desktop for anomalies or threat warning dialogs, messages, notices, etc., when Firefox icon disappeared and the Firefox update status bar information dialog flashed on my screen, saying something like ""please wait for Firefox to refresh..."" when it disappeared being instantly replaced by the updated Firefox's 'welcome screen' but in a new style which obscured nearly 3/4's of my desktop.
</p><p>After surveying the changes and NOTING FOR THE RECORD THAT ALL MY ADD-ONS AND EXTENSIONS HAD BEEN OBLITERATED WITHOUT ANY NOTICE WHATSOEVER, I resized my browser back to normal - which seems to have stuck and remains stable - where I discovered the 'Old Firefox Data' on my desktop:

</p><p>It would be very nice and minimally respectful:  to have been warned prior to such an invasive update; to be given an option to delay and prepare to accept the update - which deviates significantly from normal updates; and/or to publish some explanation and information and A LINK to a summary explanation with your braggadocios 'Welcome' page.
</p><p>As a manageable aside, many of the settings (under the Tools &gt; Options menu) were also arbitrarily changed, most notably the desired default start page(s) and the manner to reset them. Most of the new defaults were not particularly dangerous however many more default settings tend to be a bit invasive and as the wording for each category changed significantly, a bit of research had to be done to analyze and determine whether to retain or change each and every one of these - which in no way matched the previous configuration I had so diligently conformed and maintained for quite a long time...
</p><p>I shouldn't need to compose a detailed complex question for true appropriate experts to project into this situation and conceive, formulate, and promulgate an appropriate constructive informative suggestive response with some variables and options for the many other Firefox clients who will likely experience this same trauma to an otherwise beautiful start of the day...
</p><p>Searching the help files and groups, the responses are non-responses and circle-logic which tend to justify placing a folder on the desktop - and various other arbitrary and capricious anomalies - in the first place without further explanation or options or suggestions... I am genuinely amazed that any of these non-responsive response have been archived and maintained as acceptable while the situation/situations seem to persist without any procedure or reasonable remedy to avoid it/them in the first place.
</p><p>I realize that Firefox is ""free"" and many dedicated experts selflessly sacrifice your experience and expertise to improve the internet browsing experience and generally make this imperfect world a better place in which to live, evolve, and thrive, but for your apparently socially uninformed information and for the record: it is NOT reasonable to expect people to be grateful for a reach-around when they didn't want the butt-raping in the first place.
</p><p>Please publish some options that may address my restoring my browser to it's previous comfortable settings using the 'Old Firefox Data' folder and/or its contents.
</p><p>PROCESSING NOTE: Uploading an image with this newly updated Firefox just glitched... looks like a Flash or Shockwave compatibility error from the progress icon. The Options &gt; Tools &gt; Add-ons and Extensions newly designed interfaces are not revealing any useful information... perhaps this new Firefox update categorizes its own image upload interface routine as ""dangerous""??? 
</p><p>I'll insert a directory list... above... if I can safely exit this setback...

</code></pre><code>
</code><p><code></code>
</p><p>I don't know what's important and what isn't, so I haven't touched it much.

I have 2 tabs opened there.
</p><p>(Also I just noticed how Youtube's search bar doesn't appear, that's because it has been moved slightly off the of where I cropped the screenshot. Not the code's fault since I tried without it. Private browsing caused that which makes me question what else changes)
</p><p>After some searching I found this code:
</p><p><code>
</code></p><pre><code>#TabsToolbar:not([inFullscreen=""true""]) &gt; .private-browsing-indicator {
position: absolute !important;
right: 0;
bottom: 1px;

1248391,1548874977,Microphone does not work with Facebook messenger and behavior is weird.,"<p>Anytime I choose to use Firefox for audio communications it does not work. The people that I am trying to talk to does not listen anything. The cam works. To listen to the third parties I need to click on [mute my microphone] what seems to be the opposite of what should be done.
After trying to use Firefox and fail, the Firefox icon vanishes from my task bar and I need to reinstall it (Firefox entirely). After reinstall it works once, and that's it.
That is annoying! I like to use Firefox the most but do not know what to do more. 
Just for you to  know, Chrome and even Edge does not have such a behavior and both cam and mike are correctly installed and device drivers are up to date. Firefox  Privacy settings are already set for allowing microphone and camera on all microphone demanding sites I use (in this case Facebook Messenger). There are no restrictions applied by Win10 Pro for those devices. Could not find any good in the forums related to this behavior.
My version of Firefox is 65.0 (64-bit). Should I drop it and use Chrome?

1248444,1548894062,"iframes, sessions within iframes, CORs & 3rd Party Cookies - Any documentation, and interaction should allow cookies?","<p>As a web developer, I create a lot of embeddable cross origin iframe widgets.  Unfortunately, if you have configured the Firefox setting of ""Block cookies and site data"" to ""Cookies from unvisited websites"", my iframe widgets no longer work when used on a cross origin domain, as they rely on user sessions.  Is there any documentation that defines what 3rd party cookies are?  I understand some users want to block them (as I myself was doing until I realized that would break my iframe widgets), but what I don't understand is why the cookies are continually blocked if a user specifically interacts with an iframe widget.  Doesn't user interaction imply it's now a visited website?  I should think the first load of the iframe would trigger blocked cookies, but if the user interacts with the iframe content willingly (by clicking a button which triggers an ajax call, for example), any resulting cookies should be respected even if Firefox is set to block 3rd party cookies.  I'm all for blocking 3rd party cookies that are loaded dynamically and are unwelcome, but if the user starts interacting with these iframes or controls, it would make sense to allow cookies, and that would be enough for my apps to not be broken if the user blocks 3rd party cookies.  I think web developers need a solution for keeping their legitimate cross origin apps from being blocked by 3rd party cookie settings if users are interacting and using them.
</p><p>I put together a sample application that shows how Firefox blocking third party cookies completely breaks sessions (since the cookie that is returned from the iframe call is discarded / not used).
</p><p><a href=""https://github.com/own3mall/firefox-3rd-party-cookies-test"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/own3mall/firefox-3rd-party-cookies-test</a>
</p><p>I created a basic test to see if I could get Firefox to maintain sessions with iframes using a cross origin domain as the source. Unfortunately, I could not. Is there any work-around, or an easy way to detect the user's 3rd party cookie settings so I can warn them? I'd still like to know what is considered 3rd party, and what happens if you visit the cross origin domain directly in another tab before interacting with that iframe. Is it still considered 3rd party then?  What is the behavior and rules for this?  
</p><p>This seems like a serious problem that needs a better solution, and I like the interaction idea.

Just a simple use case. take one of these urls:
data:text/html,&lt;input type=""text""&gt;
data:text/html,&lt;textarea&gt;
data:text/html,
Enter some data and save the page. Entered data will be saved as well.
Currently, I have two Firefox profiles on two different Linux (Ubuntu) machines when Firefox doesn't save input fields while I am using these profiles. When I create another profiles, input fields are saved again.  So, it is profile based issue. Firstly I noticed this strange behavior several years ago. Then I created a new profile and imported everything from the ""bad"" one. I am still keeping that ""bad"" profile on my old Ubuntu box. Now I have two more ""bad"" profiles on two different boxes.
Is there any explanation of this behavior? Is it just a bug?

- Reinstalling, making sure I took an en-US download

We're a TLS everywhere, VPN everywhere shop. We very much know the implications of security workarounds. TL;DR: Shibboleet.
</p><p>While deploying our systems, we routinely have to directly access our customers' legacy systems that are ridden with SSL/TLS problems of almost every category: outdated algorithms, inadequate key lengths, hardcoded certificates, reused serials and so on. Some of these limitations can be worked around in the browser, others require configuring insecure settings, a few cannot be done away with. ""Contacting the site admininistrator and letting them know there's something wrong with their site"" is a non-option here. We're talking about *unfixable* systems whose design life is measured in two-digit years.
</p><p>The question is: how am I supposed to cope with this? Where is the big red switch to throw security out of the window for RFC1918 networks for the next half an hour? Where can I donate my left kidney? Where is the altar where I can sacrifice a goat to your preferred deity?

I would check the screenshot with alt+tab, then alt+tab back to the browser, type part of the string (lets say 4 characters), then alt+tab back to the image to check the rest of it... Now whenever i alt+tab back to the browser, it would select the entire text inside the password container instead of just leaving it as it is, thus making me replace the text I've already typed instead of just adding to it. That also happens a lot with the address bar.
Now I'm a pretty unfocused individual, and I know I can press the right arrow key on the keyboard to just avoid this selection, but it seems like firefox is the only browser who does that sort of thing and it always gets me on surprise. Then I have this whole frustration moment, because that usually happens when I got to rush and log in, and when I'm already finishing the input.
Is there any way to force firefox to stop this selection madness?

1248584,1548966841,Is there any way to see what page my firefox has open?,"<p>I am running a standalone (Raspberry Pi linux) system using Firefox ER (in order to use mkiosk addon). No server, just local web pages on the system. The system allows our non-profit museum's visitors to get information on any of the 150+ artifacts we have, each one being a web page. Firefox starts with the homepage, then the user can go into the desired web page by touching the screen. Mkiosk can detect when the user has not done anything for a set period (2 minutes in our case) and then it resets back to the home screen. Works like a charm! No apache server needed or wanted for simplicity - just a bunch of pages and links.
However, I want to be able to either do other (non-firefox) things when the home web page has been showing for 5 minutes (which means nobody is using the system). Some things are 
1) Outputting a voice message to invite users to try the system
2) Bringing up a different firefox profile with an entirely different set of pages
3) Bringing up a different application on the screen.
</p><p>I am a highly experienced (30+ years) unix person so writing the code is not a problem. What I can't do is to find what page firefox has open (only one page - no tabs - are open at any time. I tried linux's ""atime"" parameter to check which page was accessed last but atime is not updated because that would require the system write to the disk for every read to update that info and that's a real burden on the micro-sd card used as a disk.
</p><p>Is there any way to see from firefox's files or from a communication from firefox (like having it log to a file which I could read) so I can tell what file is being displayed on the screen at any point in time (or just to know when the homepage is being displayed)?

</p><p>Adding to that predicament, the only browser I think that isn't wrapped up in Google's &amp; MS's web, is hopefully Firefox's browser, but my Yahoo's 'final' email today links apparently to only installing FF's latest browser.  Or might as I suspect, I can use an older version of FF, one that's compatible with Outlook 2007 and one that Yahoo aka 'Google-hoo' will 'leave me/us be'?
</p><p>Ultimately I'm wanting to keep what works (my money too), despite the flaunted less secure-ness of W7 and Outlook 2007, because I believe I'm savvy enough to likely avoid the touted pitfalls by avoiding online banking, not e-mailing company's I've not researched beforehand, maintaining reliable and respected AV, etc., etc.).
</p><p>So I'm hopeful can find a FF version that'll support Outlook 2007's e-mail application and  hopefully (only later use will likely tell) browser which still supports Yahoo mail.  Or am I simply being blocked by the expected deals being made designed to force users into buying into Windows 10?
</p><p>Accordingly I suspect if I go with FF's v65, likely I might any longer be able to use my Outlook 2003's email handler, and only be able to send and receive via or through FF's email application, thus likely not the convenience of being able to use my email storage application (Fogware e-mail backup and relocator) to export each year's sent, rec'd emails.
</p><p>So likely as not, I'll be forced to use other means of saving them as mentioned, possibly via FF's browser.  But heck, I found it nearly impossible just to unhide what the current version f FF's browser is (v65), let alone what 'Google-hoo's up to.
</p><p>Long of the short of it is, might someone in the know be able to tell me anything towards what we're dealing with here and how best to go about assuring I can still get my <a href=""http://yahoo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">yahoo.com</a> addressed e-mails if not only through FF's browser, then hopefully also thru Outlook 2007?
</p><p>From what I can find and confirm, might FF's v65 browser actually cross link with my Outlook 2003's handler, or if not then surely with Outlook's 2007's e-mail application by simply acquiring a full version of Office '12'?

1248633,1548994600,Is there a way to remove the unmute icon button that appeares in tabs when muted?,"<p>So to elaborate, when a tab is muted, the ""unmute"" button icon is situated right next to the ""close tab"" button. I always keep everything muted unless i specifically want to hear sounds from for example youtube, occasionally facebook and the like. 
These buttons are way too close to each other and i keep clicking either one i don't want to click at the time by accident again and again. I want the unmute button to go away forever, i can just rightclick and use that menu for unmuting.
Every time i try to bring my issue onto the ""almighty"" google, it's always unrelated, and no, the setting of browser.tabs.showAudioPlayingIcon to false in about:config does not do anything since it's not the audio playing icon, but the unmute icon that's the problem.

- delete the favicons.sqlite file
- run the Checkmarks extension which loads all the bookmarked sites

- create  new profile
- copy the bookmark address, open a new tab, paste the address, save the bookmark, delete the old one

I had Firefox up and working for years, though I had been using it rarely in the past couple of years. Still, I even had it ""divided"" between home and a couple of business versions (however that should be referred to). Then, tiring of Chrome (and hating Safari), I though I'd try Firefox again. When I cranked it up, I got a note that said I should update Firefox. So, like a reasonable user, I hit the go button, as it were. Smart move? My reply to that would involve many phrases and words not to be used in polite company. MY Firefox disappeared. Gone. Everything. Settings, bookmarks, ""users."" It was as if I had never, ever installed Firefox before. Virgin Firefox, one might say. Pure, unsullied, unused. So where the hell is MY Firefox? If I can get it back, I'll be delighted. If it indeed, as seems to be the case from my viewpoint at the moment, it is gone forever, then, well, sadly, I will be an ex-Firefox user forever. I can't see any reason for me to try to rebuild it all. Chrome may be annoying, but it does work and work well.

</p><p>I use a zillion of different profiles and for some settings, I have to use a ""mozilla.cfg"" file to not lose my mind (and my disk space, deleting the cache upon closing is mandatory).  I use different profiles at the same time, and because auto-update has ALWAYS messed up the browsing sessions, I MUST set the auto-update to manual. Not disable it, I just want to install the update when I'm ready to close ALL my currently opened profiles/browsing sessions.
</p><p>Now with the new auto-update policy, this gets a mess ...
</p><p>In the preferences GUI, I tried changing the setting ""Automatically update"" to ""Check for updates but let you choose to install them"" and monitored about:config, to no avail. No setting gets changed.
The most recently created profiles do not even have an ""app.update.auto / .enabled"" in about:config.
</p><p>There's the ""DisableAppUpdate"" in the new policy stuff, but that's not what I want (""This policy turns off application updates"").
</p><p>So, how can I set the manual update setting GLOBALLY ?
</p><p>Bonus question: the new policy way, compared to the mozilla.cfg way, seems to remove the possibility to pick between DEFAULTING and FORCING a preference (defaultPref / lockPref). Am I right ? If so, why ?

Note:  I noticed that very briefly when firefox loads up, it flashes on the

I thought maybe it was getting stuck on that page (sort of like a

1248503,1549221093,arrow keys not always working when navigating google images,"<p>Hi guys,
I've had this problem for a few months now on both my laptop and desktop. It only happens when using firefox and doesn't seem to affect other browsers. When trying to navigate google images with the arrow keys (with 1 image selected as the hero image in the middle) that the arrow keys only work sporadically. They might work for moving to the next 2 images then stop working, then if i click with the mouse they'll navigate 1 image across then not work again. I have to browse through images every day and this is putting a huge brake on how fast I can do my job. Any chance someone has come across this before as I can't really find anything on it??

""The more memory is used the better because it means you don't have RAM wasted. Firefox uses RAM to make its processes faster since application data is transferred much faster in RAM.""
Firefox developers, do you really think so? That eat all available memory for your ONE application is a good strategy?!

When a link is left-clicked, it runs ""checkme.php"" to verify the user and log the request to a database, them reforms the mp3 name to ""name-of-file.mp3"", and opens it. Right-clicking, then ""save link as"" would normally still do the logging, then provide a ""save as"" dialog box with the suggested filename ""name-of-file.mp3"" to allow a copy to be saved locally. PDF files are also handled the same way. Both right- and left-click functions have worked verifiably for years in IE, Edge, Chrome and others, and across all sorts of operating systems, but the ""save link as"" function doesn't work in Firefox Quantum. Early versions of Firefox apparently perform a correct ""save link as"" a given page once, but then fail until the page is refreshed ... it's an annoyance, but it does at least do the job. Left-clicking always works properly. However, the ""save link as"" function in Firefox Quantum won't work at all - the ""save as"" dialog box comes up with ""checkme.php"" as the suggested filename (which is wrong!), but then saves nothing ... in fact, when some dummy text is written into ""checkme.php"", no output is produced - it's as though ""checkme.php"" isn't even being accessed. Any clues? (Sorry - troublehooting info says ""We're sorry, but we can't find what you're looking for."". OS=Windows 7, browser=Firefox Qantum V65.0). Thanks.

In summary, I have 3 important websites that I cannot access or navigate using Firefox, BUT CAN ACCESS AND NAVIGATE USING SAFARI.
I prefer, and been a loyal user/promoter of Mozilla products for decades especially for their versatility, and superior security.  I hope that something can be done, so that these important sites will again fully function using Firefox.

Soon after, it stops, and the loading circle appears. If I click on the video, or press space, the pause/play icon acts as normal, and the loading circle disappears. If I try to unpause it, either through clicking the video, or pressing space, it simply remains paused. I have tried closing and reopening FF.

1249077,1549327430,Firefox 65 UserChrome.css Not working,"<p>Hello,
For quite a while I was using a custom UserChrome.css that removed minimize\maximize\close buttons from the tab bar.
It looked like this:
</p><p><code>
/* Firefox userChrome.css */
</code></p><p><code>@namespace url(""<a href=""http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul</a>"");
</code></p><p><code>/* Hide min, max, close in title bar */
</code></p><code>
<ol><li>titlebar-min, #titlebar-max, #titlebar-close
</li></ol>
<p>{ display: none !important; }
</p><p>/* Hide minimize, restore, close in full screen */
</p>
<ol><li>minimize-button, #restore-button, #close-button
</li></ol>
</code><p><code>{ display: none !important; }
</code>
</p><p>But after latest update (to Firefox 65 I believe) the app doesn't recognize the code in UserChrome.css.
</p><p>I understand from Fx 65 change notes there were some changes to how Firefox parses css, isn't it?
</p><p>What should I do to make UserChrome.css work? 
</p><p>I would appreciate any other method of removing minimize\maximize\close buttons from the tab bar if it isn't doable with UserChrome.css now.
</p><p>EDIT: forum formatting doesn't show the code correctly. Here's pastebin: <a href=""https://pastebin.com/1cBDgCJs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://pastebin.com/1cBDgCJs</a>

I had to load google chrome at sears suggestion to print the all 3 pages of the label. I am using Foxit Phantom and normally works fine. Do I have a bug or does sears have some proprietary connection that only works with chrome? They said they do not but do find chrome works better for them.  I've been using firefox from your beginning longer ago than most folks working there and haven't had troubles until today.
Your advise will be greatly appreciated
