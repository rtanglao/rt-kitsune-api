You pick the 'most visited' sites and they are NOT my 'most visited' sites because such sites as twitter and wikipedia both appear and in the 21 years I have owned a computer I have NEVER visited either of these trashy sites and I would never lower myself to visit such trash and I would never want anyone to think I would lower myself to visit such trashy sites.  Further, sites that I do visit each and every single day of my life such as Cambridge Dictionary do not appear on my most visited list and I find that equally offensive.  Clearly only idiots choose your 'most visited' list and I want this offense corrected, like...NOW!!!  Thank you.

</p><p>I have it backed up, after a fashion, using Tab Session Manager, which doesn't restore vertical history of each tab (CAN'T, because of the new extensions API; frankly that's one part that I would've considered blocking the move entirely to WebExtensions as even before Quantum FF's session restore was entirely too hopeless without the session manager addon), I kinda need that history.
</p><p>So, is there even anything I can do? Or is it all done and I should just down-grade till a power fault doesn't lose me information that it perfectly had in check? (given the recovery files are being updated, even after the crash FF surely had the latest versions of those to work from)

1216918,1525866773,"Crashed again, all tabs lost","<p>Good day, my Firefox (fully up-to-date) crashed quite a few times in recent weeks. This time All my tabs are Lost. I had about 120 open. I closed Firefox before I wanted to shut down the PC (Windows 10 with April 2018 update) and get a Firefox crash notification. As per usual, I click restore and all my tabs came up! Closed Firefox again - no notifications.
This morning, when I opened Firefox, I got 3 tabs - Google Mail sign in, Facebook sign in and an empty tab.
I read up on the issue everywhere (using Chrome!!) and then Mozilla support. I was directed to 2 posts. The one did not apply to me and the other one was so technically demanding that a person with average computer knowledge simply could not follow that to and fro.
So now, how do I get my tabs back?  I had gone to sessionstore-backups and only found 2 entries: see attached image, both are from today, Not yesterday!
I am stumped

1216922,1525867892,Websites become unresponsive but can still be scrolled through and the hand cursor appears all the time,"<p>In the past weeks, suddenly my Firefox started behaving really weird - a few times a day the currently opened tab becomes unresponsive (you can't click or hover anything) but you can still scroll through them (at least a bit - after that point, it's just plain white). At these times, the cursor is the hand one, during the whole unresponsiveness episode, as if everything was clickable (though obviously clicking does nothing). You also can't close the tab during this tab - the only way is either to wait a good 30 seconds for it to unfreeze or to change to a different tab and close the unresponsive one. When you do change tabs, though, the newly opened tab sometimes disappears completely, with a radial loading circle appearing in the middle of the screen for a few seconds before it magically reappears (it does _not_ reload, though!). From what I've been able to observe, this tends to appear on content-heavy websites like Reddit, Facebook and YouTube most often.
</p><p>What is happening? I haven't changed my browsing habits in the past weeks, nor have I installed any new add-ons. I've tried disabling the ones I have but it's still happening with them turned off. What else may I try?

Unfortunately, with firefox 60, this advice no longer works. The best I can get is just top sites only, but the icons for this only show the top site's icon rather than a screenshot of the page. These are much too small, leaving loads of blank page around them (and adding more top sites would make the new tab page much too busy); and the icons &amp; titles chosen aren't very useful (e.g., the icon for the google maps page is just the google logo with the title ""google"", this isn't very informative).
</p><p>To paraphrase:
</p><p>browser.newtabpage.activity-stream.aboutHome.enabled = False
</p><p>browser.newtabpage.activity-stream.enabled = False
</p><p>But activity stream won't die!
</p><p>Is it possible to change back, without giving up and just installing the ESR firefox? I like the lower ram usage of quantum, but the UI is a deal breaker.

I don't want to make the installation directory writable by ordinary user, so when notified by Firefox that it could not install updates I used sudo to start it in a root privilege mode to allow installation of the updates, then I shut it down and started as an ordinary user again. 
Beginning version 60 this is no more possible, requiring either complete manual install, or starting a complete Gnome/KDE session for root just to allow Firefox to update (sorta clumsy...).
If it is absolutely necessary to refuse starting under sudo, wouldn't it be possible to provide something like update-only mode of the browser which would allow running as root under sudo?

Nor do I know what version I upgraded from/. I have however tried a full uninstall of both applications and reinstalled the latest versions, with no improvement. I cannot discern any other changes or installations that may have caused this.)

</p><p>I have an Alienware 15R3 with 16GB of RAM + Windows 10 ( with lastest updates). Since the last Firefox update to version 59.0.3, every time I play a video from Youtube or any other video platforms, it consumes up to 6.5GB of RAM, no matter if video is 4K, 1080p or 144p. Also, fullscreen mode is unaccesable and trying to close the tab takes  to long. In case you wonder, this occurs with only one tab open, the one used to play the video, no more programs, no more tabs or downloads, nor extensions added neither.

The laptop in question is a Clevo P641HK1 barebone, with an i7-7700HQ processor, Intel HD630 graphics, Nvidia 1050Ti graphics, 16GB of DDR4 Ram and a Samsung 960 Pro NVMe SSD.
</p><p>The issue I am having is that, quite often, using Firefox would cause my screen to flash black multiple times a second, thereby making my notebook unusable. It also often shortly blacks the screen when minimizing Firefox. I've tried using safe mode as well as changing the hardware acceleration settings, but it made no difference. As it stands I am convinced that this is somehow related to Firefox using my Intel GPU in a certain way that would trigger this behavior.

I recently switched over to Firefox as my default browser. It's been working fine for the past few weeks until now. Every single site I try to open receives the 'Your connection is not secure' warning. This occurs even on the Mozilla site itself. Can you help please or I'll have to revert to Chrome which I really don't want to do.

The 'restore last session' tab is unavaible since there was no crash of any kind and 'closed tabs' was clean too.
I've now spent a few hours looking through the forum for fixes and tried just about everything.
As many posts direct you to, I've checked the 'sessionstore-backups' folder in my profile folder to get the .json files, however there's ONLY the recovery.baklz4 and recovery.jsonlz4 files present, even with hidden files and folders turned on. So i'm missing the previous.js and upgrade.js.
I found one other user (post here <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1214114)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1214114)</a> who had this issue as well and found the missing files with ShadowExplorer, but in my case the old sessionstore folder found through ShadowExplorer still had only the very recent recovery.bak and recovery.json. I also tried the other program linked in the thread, but it requires system restore points, which I don't have enabled.
I even checked all the .bak and .json files I could find with <a href=""https://www.jeffersonscher.com/res/scrounger.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.jeffersonscher.com/res/scrounger.html</a> for htmls, but there's only the tabs from the session after I lost all the old ones.
My old session probably had 200+ tabs from from the past few months, some were a bit important or job-hunting related (the most relevant ones were bookmarked, luckily).

Well my concern  is because with Google Chrome (I know that is offensive to compare) I have open more than 30 tabs and its ram consumption is understanble to be higher, nevertheless is really close to mozilla ( Lets say 1GB of RAM). I tried to run mozilla on safe mode with no addons but I get the same result. I tried reduce the content process limit to 2 (4 by default) but again, the RAM consumption still high. I reinstall mozilla, but unfortunately nothing changes. Im the only one with this trouble? Any ideas of what it can be?
The mozilla version what Im using is 60 x64 and windows 10 x64
Thanks in advance

</p><p>Popped out a new window in the background when I highlighted some text.
</p><p>1. Every time JavaScript is used to pop-up a new tab or window, an icon should be made available to report the site for unwanted pop-ups. The site could be added to a blacklist. The blacklist should be downloaded in whole rather than queried on Firefox servers for privacy (Mozilla does care about privacy doesn't it?).
</p><p>2. If a site is on the blacklist and it tries to pop-up a tab/window then the popup could be blocked and same icon could highlight for say 10 seconds. Clicking the icon in this case would give the options to open the popup, white-list the page for the user, vote against the blacklist. Something like:
</p><p>[  ] Show the blocked page.
[  ] White-list this site for me.
[  ] I don't think this site should be blacklisted
</p><p>[ OK ]    [Cancel]
</p><p>Some fuzzy logic could perhaps be used to determine whether or not to keep sites on the blacklist. Sites with very large amounts of blacklisting+white-listing could be manually looked at.
</p><p>Also: 
I don't ever want anything happening when I highlight text other than the text being high-lighted, it's not necessary and it completely ruins the browsing experience. No excuses, it's bad. Add a white-list if necessary for the 0.01% edge cases where this might be useful.

A whole bunch of sites said that it was a virus of some description, probably a tracking and adware virus, though those seemed to be sites wanting you to pay for their products too. 
</p><p>One of these sources did suggest that it was a 'potentially unwanted program', so I scanned my computer with malwarebytes and quarantined the two potentially unwanted programs it suggested, which were both in the mozilla folder of Appdata/Roaming but when opening it up again and testing it by googling something, it was trackid=sp-006 appended to it. Here is an example:
</p><p><a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=hello+world&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;channel=fs&amp;trackid=sp-006"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/search?q=hello+world&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;channel=fs&amp;trackid=sp-006</a>

I do have ghostery installed, so will that help at all in not being tracked by malicious sources in cases like this? also, I have avast and httpseverywhere installed too. 
</p><p>so in short:
1: is Trackid=sp-006 a virus or a tracker? 
2: how do I remove it?

Although it is possible to turn them off, for some reason Mozilla removed the option to enter the user's preferred URL to open. The recommended solution to this, as I read in some threads, is to install an add on. Why do I need to install an add on to restore a functionality you removed? And, why did you remove it anyway? What harm can a user inflict by being greeted with a familiar page when opening a new tab.
</p><p>I will repeat the request I have read several times, in more polite words: Please bring back this feature that many users seem to miss. Forcing the user to open an unfamiliar page in a new tab does not make much sense from user experience design perspective and providing this option causes no harm to Firefox.

Currently, the caption only shows the title for the focus-tab in each window.
(b) Have each window automatically save the tabs that are open in that window whenever I close that window. This would enable us to close one window and save the tabs for it, without closing all other windows. 
(c) Allow me to select from named unopened windows in the context menu of FF on the task bar, which would then open that particular window with all its previously saved tabs. This would allow me to open only the named windows I want. Currently, it's open all windows or nothing.

1217420,1526144143,Why is Firefox returning only ONE PAGE of search results? I want exhaustive results. Advanced Search option is useless for addressing this.,"<p>I'm a retired PhD with multiple in depth interests, and I use the web as a resource daily, to look for practical information as well as for news and music, etc. 
</p><p>Firefox has been my preferred browser for over a decade because of its versatility and - before now - its user friendliness for both low- and high-information content Web users. I've become reliant on Ixquick as other search engines have been relentlessly dumbed down in the last few years.
</p><p>When I run a search, I expect relevant results, according to the parameters I specify in the search syntax. I then expect to decide for myself which of these results are most likely to be useful - i.e., I do not want random results, including terms I have specifically excluded, with an arbitrary limit on number of hits returned. 
</p><p>Examples may help. I have sought information on correlations between mammography OR sonography AND metastatic disease, for one example, or an MSDS with the LD50 of elemental sulphur, which I use as a garden fungicide and do not want to harm wildlife with, for another, or on the best way to add insulating night curtains to existing window treatments, for a third, or the effects of B AND/OR D vitamin deficiency on cognition in the elderly.  None of this information is so obscure that nobody would ever be expected to look for it. It should also be quite easy to set very specific terms for all these searches and obtain highly relevant results.
</p><p>Yet search engines in general have become so badly dumbed down that none of those searches now return clean - or even relevant - results for many hits they bring back - no matter what I do to limit the search. Even IxQuick is beginning to bring back more and more trash hits.
</p><p>It now appears that IxQuick has been completely savaged. It returns ten results, no more, one page, no more. It ignores normal search syntax such as quotes, + and - signs, and Boolean operators. The Advanced function page is a placebo - does not clearly allow for expanding the number of hits returned, and ignores input into the ""restrictive"" search fields that are available there, such that one might as well not use them at all. Also, it seems impossible to change search settings to any meaningful extent on the Options page (in the wake of the latest update). [Side comment: combining the cookie and data cache access into one radio button was a really dirty trick to play on those of us who like to clear the cache independently. Please separate them in your next update.]
</p><p>I am still able to obtain multi-page results if I search in DuckDuckGo, but I set IxQuick as default for a reason. I would like to continue using it.  Are there any fixes available through Firefox that will allow me to resume ""intelligent"" searches in IxQuick now, and obtain extensive results that actually conform to the search terms I have specified?
</p><p>Thank you. Apologies for any snark - it's not intended. As an intelligent user, I find this incredibly frustrating, and every time it changes, it becomes worse, not better.

Couple years back this was happening in Safari and Chrome but not FFox. That is why I switched to FFox. Since later upgrades, Safari &amp; Chrome no longer display gibberish. All forums I went to had no answers not even tech support. So I stayed with FFox. Don't care to go back. Has always performed smoothly. But if this new glitch isn't fixed very shortly, I'll go back to them. Going forward with new upgrade only to go backward with text displays.

It also resets my preferences - which is truly annoying because it defaults to Yahoo search, which is not my preferred search engine. This happens at least once a day.

Something is triggering playback of the audio portion of the video. The viewable video player IS NOT PLAYING however. For example if I were to click the play button this will introduce a SECOND audio plus the video video.  Also the audio auto-plays until I leave the page and the problem resumes all over again if I go to another edit page for another video. This problem began a week or two ago and I notice it doesn't happen on Google Chrome so I'm assuming it's related to the browser.

The first tab starts off with ""New Tab"" as its label then after a couple of seconds changes to ""Google"" as the tab label.  This is the correct first homepage.  It's a little issue but somewhat annoying not to have the correct label show immediately.  This does not occur in Internet Explorer.  Why an interim label before the correct one shows?

1217577,1526267554,Firefox will not play view.yahoo videos,"<p>Firefox 59.0.2/3 on MacOS 10.12.06 will not play streaming videos from
<a href=""http://view.yahoo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">view.yahoo.com</a> - I tried several different videos.
	Symptom: When I try to play a video I get a black
box, clicking on it has no effect. Sometimes I get a brief image from
the video in the black box along with a small black box off to the
side, but both quickly disappear.
	What I can do: I can play videos from youtube and pbs.
Some other browsers, eg. chrome, will play the yahoo
videos, but initially Safari would not, giving the same results as
Firefox. When I choose the Safari per website option to disable content
blockers, the previously brief image remained and I could then play the
video.
	What I tried: I disabled all the content blockers I could find,
including: ad blockers and flash restrictions.  I reinstalled Firefox,
going from 59.0.2 to 59.0.3 with no change in behavior; I reinstalled
flash.  I tried restarting Firefox in safe mode, with the same results
as above.
</p><p>I prefer to stick with Firefox, so are any suggestions to fix this
problem?
</p><p>Thanks,
John

I did this by visiting wikipedia, right clicking on the search bar, and selecting ""Add a keyword for this search."" As I understand it, this menu item uses the same OpenSearch data that Chrome uses to automatically add and create search keywords.
</p><p>In Chrome, when I type `w&lt;tab&gt;bill`, the first item in the popup menu is a command to search wikipedia for ""bill."" below that, it gives me suggestions that come from Wikipedia: Bill Clinton, Bill Gates, Billy Graham.
</p><p>In Firefox, when I type `wiki bill`, the first item in the pop-up is to search wikipedia for ""bill."" But after that, the following results look like results from *google* search suggestions for the phrase ""wiki bill"". This is obviously not as useful :)
</p><p>The search bar, when enabled, is even worse than the awesome bar - it doesn't accept keywords, so I have to type in `bill` and then switch to my mouse to click the wikipedia icon (which appears below the google search suggestions).
</p><p>So, is there any way to use OpenSearch search suggestions, either in the awesome bar or anywhere in firefox (other than making that my default search engine for all searches)?

I am totally frustrated with FF. It used to work very beautifully in the last few years until recently I found that one update screwed my browsing experience. Right now , whether in safe mode or not,private browsing even with hardware acceleration disabled , it won't load pages . For example when I luckily arrived to open a page containing links , when I try to open those links on a new tab, the tab won't load the page at all, I have to keep opening tabs till at least one successfully opens , sometimes I have to try twice or three times to get it open on a new tab, I tried the same with a new window, same problem. I saw that there are others who had the same issue and probably still have this issue till now. 
I dare to say this is a bug that need to be fixed. I had disabled all add-ons ,no luck, even uninstalled FF and removed firefox profiles, no luck. However FF is working fine on my other PC, both are windows 7. I don't want to go back to Internet explorer, Chrome is fine but I liked FF.Please share your solution if you had this issue resolved. FF developers, please provide some fix. By the way, I tried the beta FF version 61 ,I have the same issue as well.

I'm absolutely certain the file is located where it shows it should be, so I don't know what's happening here.
</p><p>I contacted the chat resource for the Notepad++ group and was told that it is a problem with Firefox v60.0, but they didn't know how to fix it and advised I just switch to another browser. I'd rather stay with Firefox, but with the installation of this most recent version - I'm starting to question whether I should.

Then I tried renaming it in windows explorer, changing the ""default"" ending to my name - the firefox profile manager still isn't seeing it.  Finally, from a support question here, I tried going up one level into the firefox folder, and renaming the ""profile.ini"" to ""profileOLD.ini""  That simply created a new blank default profile, and when I launched firefox it said that mozilla hadn't properly formatted their security certificates and an exception couldn't be made... so I deleted the newly created ""profile.ini"" file, and put the ""profileOLD.ini"" back to just ""profile.ini"" - and now firefox launches properly and I'm back where I began, still unable to access the profile I'm trying to import.

1217832,1526415358,"Are you going to fix the problem with Firefox freezing the PC when it stumbles upon and loads ""badly coded"" websites?","<p>Or whatever is the problem?
ok, some context.
Ever since I upgraded (with some lag because, yes, I did expect this, to some extent) to quantum, Firefox is regularly freezing my PC by hogging ALL of the RAM. (Win7 PC, 8GB RAM)
</p><p>I checked via taskmanager etc and usually it´s some variant of millions of javascript or scripts being loaded. For whatever reason, since most cases I am not doing anything active with it, just reading in my ao3-tab.
And the thing is, as I said, I expected some problems. The last big update before that I had similar problem, though to a lesser extent. But with a few updates that went away. Not this time.
</p><p>It appears to be fairly independent of the number of tabs opened, too. I am admittedly something of a tab-messy, so my first attempt to was to cut down to a few windows with maybe a dozen to twenty tabs in-all. I even started a with a single window and like 3 tabs. No diff. and no, no youtube there, btw. Deactivated the few addons I had on. no diff.
</p><p>I really did not want to have to google this problem, so I waited, hoping for a helpful update. and no improvements came my way. So I did look here, and yes I did have to update my graphics drivers (geforce) and yes I did deactivate the Hardware acceleration in Options - General, and yes I did tell Firefox to assume my PC is on the weak side and use ""2"" instead of the default.
To exactly no effect.
</p><p>And I keep reading, in each of these threads, that, hey, maybe the user should check which evil website is doing this, and some grumpy lizard part of my brain has by now turned into a volcano. I had my PC ""freeze"" three, hah, no, four times while I typed this here. (as in, the RAM maxxes out for periods of.. up to half an hour, during which the entire PC is best left untouched)
</p><p>Yes, I do have other windows open. No, I did not do anything with them. Are you seriously trying to tell my that the new and improved browser of the future cannot handle that? did you somehow include something that makes the browser routinely look through all its tabs and just reload them (and any potential crap-scripts) because hey shits and giggles?
</p><p>And, please, are you really telling me this new improved browser was not checked in how he deals with websites that are not made to standard??
This is the internet. This has been the internet for decades. any kind of standard being used in any kind of fashion is a niceity, a fluke almost, are you really telling me to just not browse sites that might (as has unfortunately become the norm) load something or other from other websites, be it for ads or statistics or whatever?? really????
</p><p>No I have not killed my profile yet. I have used this profile for several years, and now I actually went and got a tool to export my PW-data. Getting ready to torch it. Will update if that fixes it.
</p><p>But, really. What exactly did you do that made a functioning browser into this awful zombie? and can you please fix it. Because seriously, much as I got my rant on, the very idea of version 0.3 of the newest bestest browser reacting to uncomfortable/messy websites/content in such  manner is just absurd. As is the idea of routinely reloading every tab, no matter if it is currently needed. That would certainly be a double killer, to load all scripts/media and then do it in a way that makes it into an eternal loop of doom. please tell me it´s not like that. And please tell me when it is/might be fixed. because like this I can´t use it.

""Web Attack:  Fake Tech Support Website 62"".  This has been going on for about a 3 days now.
Is there anything you can do to your FireWall and Other Security Software from allowing this Virus from trying to attack Mozilla FireFox?
Please advise.

1217891,1526449457,"PDF:  One PDF opens, another shows downloadpanel, why?","<p>It strikes me that Firefox sometimes behave differently when clicking on a PDF link.
It may open the PDF (my preferred way), so I can view it and decide whether I would like to save it or not (Options-&gt;Applications-&gt;Preview in Firefox is set), but with another PDF it will show me the download panel, offering to either download or open in Acrobat.
</p><p>How come that Firefox is acting differently?

1217892,1526449922,Firefox is very slow/ laggy and practically impossible to use,"<p>So I decided to use my laptop that I haven't used for over about four months or so, when I launched Firefox it updated and as far as I can remember before the update it worked perfectly. I have tried many of the fixes online such as restarted it with add-ons disabled, refreshed it, install the 32 bit version, running Firefox As Administrator, My OS is Windows 10 (64-bit) , any help will be appreciated.

While for the same in chrome or IE, I can see the full DOM model. 
</p><p>I can see that in the main HTML tag, the class property is : lc-cb-container-vi , which I guess is something weird. 
</p><p>If I remove this class, absolutely nothing happens.

1217894,1526450341,key4.db file gets corrupted after I close the borwser,"<p>Hello FF team.
</p><p>starting with FF update 56 to 57 and so on I got this strange problem: it looks like my key4.db file gets corrupted and FF become almost useless after I access my saved passwords and then exit the browser. If I delete the key4.db file (I still have the key3.db and logins.json files in profile folder) everything works fine. The key4.db file is generated, my passwords are there and I can use them till next browser exit/restart. Here are the symptoms:
</p><p>- upon start the browser directly asks for master password (normally I'm asked for the master password only when I really need it)
- no browsing history is shown in the address bar
- enter key and 'Go to...' button do not work at all (I can only open a site if it is bookmarked)
- when I go to browser's options there is nothing under 'Search' section - in other words the content cannot be loaded or displayed
- when I open 'Saved Logins' dialog there is nothing 
- there are no *corrupt files in my profile directory
</p><p>So when this happens I have to exit the browser and delete the key4.db file. However if I don't access my saved logins during the session at all, there is no such problem. I can start/use/exit the browser as many times as I want and it works fine. So it looks like the access to the saved logins breaks something.
</p><p>Regards,
Ivan Mitov
