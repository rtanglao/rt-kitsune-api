1243336,1544517611,Firefox is doing something to my connection that translates in lag spikes,"<p>I first noticed this in Overwatch (OW) but also with Diablo 3. These are the only games I play online. OW has a inbuilt tool to look at it's network connection. It shows that about every 5 secs, ping spikes. There might be other stuff happening, like some loss, but I can't say for sure. This translates into choppy gameplay which is unbearable for online FPS. If you look at the attached image, you see that the spikes go to 128 ms. I normally run 44 ms.
</p><p>This symptom does not start immediately and I haven't been able to check how long it takes to start. It does go away if I close firefox down.
</p><p>I tried to:
- remove all addons
- close tabs until only home/empty tab was left
- removing/reinstalling firefox.

As an example, if I open up <a href=""http://blog.mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">blog.mozilla.org</a>, I get a SEC_ERROR_UNKNOWN_ISSUER.

However, if I click on ""View Certificate"", I get the following error: ""Could not verify this certificate because the issuer is unknown.""
</p><p>I don't know much about CAs, but it seems to be surprising how the issuer of a Root CA could be unknown, isn't that the whole point of a Root CA that it does not need to be signed by another certificate?
</p><p>The more important question: Where in my profile may I have a non-default option that causes Firefox to not trust the DigiCert Global Root CA?

1243405,1544559247,Auto fill/complete for URLs has been working differently/wonky since a couple of months ago,"<p>Firefox has changed the way its URL auto fill works a while ago. (At least 3 months ago; I remember stumbling on a reddit post from Sep 16th saying that it should be fixed with v63, which is why I waited to try it out.) It seems to be mostly with redirects, see examples below, but also with new sites: it seems to only auto complete after you visited a new site at least twice. I'm a fairly advanced user, so I'm quite convinced I've checked all possible solutions, like check settings in about:config, do a clean install, etc. Also, this behaviour has changed on both my computers and my new work pc.
</p><p>I'm fairly certain it used to work like it still does in Pale Moon, which is my preferred method
Examples:
1. If you go to <a href=""http://steampowered.com"" rel=""nofollow"">steampowered.com</a> you're forwarded to <a href=""http://store.steampowered.com"" rel=""nofollow"">store.steampowered.com</a>. If you now close the tab and type 'ste' PM autofills it to <a href=""http://steampowered.com"" rel=""nofollow"">steampowered.com</a>, Fx does not. It does suggest the page, but does not auto complete it (it does, however, autofill 'sto' to <a href=""http://store.steampowered.com"" rel=""nofollow"">store.steampowered.com</a>).
</p><p>2. The same thing happens for <a href=""http://chrome.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">chrome.google.com</a>, which redirects to <a href=""http://google.com/chrome"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com/chrome</a>
</p><p>3. <a href=""http://ikea.nl"" rel=""nofollow"">ikea.nl</a> forwards to <a href=""http://ikea.com/nl/nl/"" rel=""nofollow"">ikea.com/nl/nl/</a>. PM autofills 'ik' to <a href=""http://ikea.nl"" rel=""nofollow"">ikea.nl</a>, Fx, again, does not. It _does_ auto fill to <a href=""http://ikea.com"" rel=""nofollow"">ikea.com</a>, which is doubly annoying, because now you have to click 'to <a href=""http://ikea.nl"" rel=""nofollow"">ikea.nl</a>' every time.
</p><p>So, is this change by design? Can and will it be fixed/reverted?

1243410,1544561493,Firefox build 63 won't work on my Mac OS High Sierra Macbook Retina,"<p>Firefox has been my default browser for years and it was working super fine until built 63 rolled out (and yes, I've tried all the sub-builds released under 63 and all have the same problem). I'm stuck on Firefox 62.0.3 for now and I keep getting updtate warnings from Firefox and a beating heart banner on top of all my tabs but the reason I can't move up is Firefox itself. 
And yes, I tried all the fixes I could find here before I posted my question.
I update to 63 (even the most recent. 0.1 or whatever) and the exact same thing happen: Google, YoutTube and a Forum account I need to log into for work turn into blank pages. I get no error message, when I enter the address on the toolbar all I get is a blank page with nothing on it and the address bar showing (google, youtube and that forum site). Some websites work, like a news portal I look at, some don't, but, most importantly the triad I mentioned above doesn't, and I need them for work. They'll work on Chrome, Safari but not on Firefox 63.
I turned off Ipv6 thinking this might be it (it wasn't), turned off Little Snitch (nothing changed), turned off BitDefender (still nothing), turned off hardware acceleration, accessibility stuff, you name it, I've done it.
Then the moment I run the installer for Firefox 62 I'm back on all the sites, can see everything.
No idea what this bug is and why is it is only happening on build 63 onwards, but something major changed between 62 and 63 and that something is what is giving me all this grief.
Would a appreciate a suggestion and also would appreciate for people to look into this and try to fix it on a future Firefox update.
Thanks.

I am having trouble with Firefox not wanting to display fonts or text boxes correctly in some situations. I am providing two screen shots from a client bridge configuration page to illustrate the problem. One shot is of Firefox and the other is from the Chromium browser that came with Zorin. The boxes display perfectly in Chromium but, as you can see, there are issues in Firefox (font color is grey, font too big, box background transparent, box not large enough for text). I have tried playing with the font and color settings in preferences but all i managed to do was get the background of the text boxes to display white, unfortunately, this also caused many more appearance problems with other websites so i changed it back... I am using distro of Linux called Zorin OS 12.4. and a fresh install of Firefox 63.0.3. 
</p><p>I guess I could use the Chromium browser instead, but I'm a big fan of Firefox and would rather use it ;) ANy help would be much appreciate

1243687,1544741849,Lots of problems,"<p>Okay so I have a few problems with Firefox. I usually have problems with my browsers but this one has not fixed any of the problems I had before so I decided to bring them up now. I have reinstalled Firefox before and the problems still occur. I do not really want to install it again because I have around 31 extensions and 17 scripts. I have tried this on a fresh install and decided to ignore it but it's becoming more and more of a problem.
</p><p>1. History, so when I put the settings to not put my history on the search bar it ignores the clicked setting no matter how many times I click and un-click it, so I made it so it would not save my history. That worked but it would not save my passwords, I have a account that I have to accept on my phone. And another where I have to get a special code. This is incontinent and does not give me options to change what it remembers and what it doesn't. Also when I turned it off it actually did remember all of my passwords and accounts. 
</p><p>2. Videos, I had a problem with this back in 2013, 15, and 16 and it still happens. If I Maximize the window it starts to tear the video but if I go minimized it is fine, and if I full screen it is also fine.
</p><p>3. Firefox account this one I just don't like it being on as soon as I login.
</p><p>4. I've removed all the ""One-Click Search Engines"" I don't want and they keep coming back.
</p><p>5. Some file types (even though I have the downloader option saved to ask me where to save) just save to some random folder in %appdata% that I can't actually get into said folder by normal means. So if I close the browser it just removes it because it's not in the Downloads folder its in a hidden folder that is hidden in other folders.
</p><p>6. It saves all the search options in different websites excluding google because they have their own bad problems with google accounts. 
</p><p>Now my question is, are these issues they plan to fix or is there a way I can fix any of these?

1243705,1544762527,Firefox 63 tab.close.button.transparent.background w/ hovered background,"<p>Fx 63.0.3 in Linux.
I added a tab close button (hovered) colored background.  It's not necessarily same W x H as the inactive button transparent background - which is fine.
</p><p>I'd like to move the (inactive) 'X' close to the tab right end (did move it - not necessarily easiest way).
The bottom of red background in hovered state needs to be close to the tab bottom &amp; even with the tab's right end / side, for a better, easier target to close.  I did that - more or less. :)
</p><p>The issue (that may have no solution) is the inactive button's transparent BG is 20x20px, I believe.
So far, unless I make the hovered, colored background the same size as the inactive button's , it distorts the 'X' when the red background appears.  So the button is semi-fixed?  When hovered, it doesn't ""translate"" the X icon in the same HxW.   Yes, people are starving in Africa &amp; we're worried about pretty browsers.
</p><p>I assume because the inactive close button has different dimensions and margins than the added background does, the only way I can get the ""legs"" of the 'X' near the tab border is enter different margins for it than for the hovered, colored background?
</p>
<ul><li> Question on the last part:  *When you have a 20x20 button, originally positioned so the 'letter X' was ~ 5 - 7px from the border / end, what does Firefox ""do"" w/ the transparent part of the button, when you enter margins so the 'X' is very near the right tab border (right end of the moz-box or container)?  
</li><li> Does it in effect, 'remove' part of the transparent button, as different margins are entered, to move the button closer &amp; closer to the container's end?
</li></ul>
<p>It appears the default close button's 'X' is 10px WxH.  Since browser toolbox showed the button was 20x20px - I think, then it has a 5px margin? on all sides of the 'X'  image.
</p><p>The main goals are:
</p>
<ul><li> 1. Get more room for text on tabs.  I also changed margins on the tab icons to move them near the tab left border &amp; disabled tab text fadein.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> 2. Have a clickable background  to close tabs - that lines up at the tab bottom, right corner &amp; not have to ""fish around"" for the close button.  I have that.
</li></ul>
<p>So far, unless I make the hovered background the exact dimensions of the button, then use the exact margins on both, it will distort the X - depending on how different in size the inactive &amp; hovered sizes are.
</p><p>I couldn't find a CSS property / feature that would allow *the original* X close button to shift up or left (undistorted), when the hovered background appears.
</p><p>Maybe the original close button could be hidden during hover and a new close button specified (adding a colored BG) with a new size?  Say, 15x20 (or 30)?   As long as the hovered BG is near the bottom, right corner.
</p>
<ul><li>  I think whatever space is occupied by the width of the transparent button edge (plus padding, if any), dictates how far the tab's text can extend to the right?  Once hovered, I don't care if more or less text shows, since I'll be closing  the tab, not reading it.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> If that's true, I could modify / create an overall smaller inactive close button - allowing more text on tabs.  Or just ""remove"" the *inactive state* close button, &amp; specify the same close button  (plus red BG) for the hovered state.
</li></ul>
<p>I'm not sure how hard it would be.
</p><p>It was kind of tedious, figuring out how much negative margin values to enter (for 2 different element sizes), so they both wound up (nearly) equidistant from the tab R end.  Key word being ""nearly"".  I didn't want the 'X' touching or almost - the  tab divider line.  But I  want the hovered background touching it, to make an easier closing target. 
</p><p>In blown up screenshot(sss), it seemed if I measured the distance between the close button visible 'X' and the tab's R border (say 7px), if I entered 5px, the visible 'X' moved, but NOT so it was 2px from the R border.  It seemed something else was affecting it.

I'm sitting on my YouTube 'home' page and I see a set of 'suggestions'. I click on one of the suggested vids and watch it. Afterward, I hit the 'back' button in the browser (there is not an embedded back button in the app). Sometimes hitting the 'back' button takes me back to the same YouTube page with my suggested videos and I can watch another. Other times, hitting the 'back' button causes a new page to load and I now have a new set of suggested videos displayed.
This behavior is not consistent - sometime the page load occurs, other times the same page appears. I cannot detect a pattern to this.
What's annoying about this is that there may have been more than one thing I wanted to view on the initial 'suggested videos' section of the original page displayed. However, after watching one of the vids and hitting the 'back' button, if a new page loads, I now no longer have access to those other suggested vids I wanted to watch.
As I noted earlier, I've seen this behavior in other apps too. 
I don't know if this is the right place to ask about this, or if it's a browser thing at all, I'm just trying to understand what's causing this behavior and figure out if there's anyway for me to mitigate it.

1243814,1544826665,How can I play YouTube videos in 1080p 60fps without dropping frames?,"<p>Ever since installing Firefox Quantum there have been times when YouTube videos couldn't play at 1080p 60fps without dropping frames, but it would always work itself out within a few days.  These past few months however, the problem just won't go away.  I can play videos at 1080p or at 720p 60fps, but 1080p 60fps seems to drop more frames than not.  This is more of an issue for me now because I just recently improved my Internet enough to play videos at that resolution and not wait for them to buffer every few minutes.
</p><p>I'm using the latest version of Firefox (64.0).  I tried disabling Hardware Acceleration, as was suggested, and I guess it's a bit better, but it's still dropping about 50% of the frames according to YouTube's ""stats for nerds.""  Others have said to alter Firefox's configuration, but when I tried to, Firefox warned me not to proceed unless I knew what I was doing, which I really don't.  Some have recommended installing various add-ons, but there's always someone claiming it doesn't help.
</p><p>I've tried using Google Chrome to watch the same videos, but it causes my CPU to spike so there's constant choppiness anyway.  Microsoft Edge is the only browser I've used that seems to play these videos smoothly, but I'd rather not use it if I can help it.  I've used Firefox for years now.  I'm comfortable with it and it serves me well in most capacities.
</p><p>I've seen others ask about this, but all the answers either haven't worked for me or leave me confused.  I'm not the most tech-savvy guy, so I'd appreciate it if someone could dumb it down just enough to walk me through it.

1243839,1544846645,Continual messages from Firefox,"<p>Firefox is beginning to become more of an annoyance than it is worth - most of the reason for this is the continual string of updates, messages, click bars and pop ups it shows on start up. 
</p><p>No these are not spam or bad add ins, they are programmed interruptions inherent to FF.
</p><p>Users of FF want to get on and do things. Having to close windows with news about the latest update (and there are soooo many updates), or news that the opml feed is now on your desktop (another thing to waste time attending to) or messages about privacy or messages about syncing pages and settings or pop up messages about how FF is private etc are just plain annoying. 
</p><p>It is getting to the point where I expect to wait longer for FF to start and then have to wade through cruft, than it takes to boot the entire Windows 10 OS and deal with the Ms cruft on the log in screens. 
</p><p>If people want to learn, then they will look stuff up. So seriously - stop popping up tabs, notices, messages, dialog boxes and other cruft. Let the users just get on with using FF rather than putting up with cruft about using FF.
</p><p>FF is now officially slower to start than every other browser we have and slower than me booting an entire windows 10 pc - all because of continuous updates which don't seem to do anything for me - or most users. oh sure, you can say its for security but if you are patching security holes as regularly as you are updating FF then there is something terribly wrong in your programming standards and coding methodologies - not to mention test process.
</p><p>Its a trend to tell people about your product - but its one that annoys users. We just want to get on with using whatever - so please get out of our way and let us just use the product.

1244141,1545081010,Firefox freezes with static pages,"<p>Firefox freezes as if perpetually loading - it is caused by 'static' pages. Examples are gstatic of google, ebaystatic of eBay or geekdo-static of <a href=""http://boardgamegeek.com"" rel=""nofollow"">boardgamegeek.com</a> (all .com extension). It has something to do with a script because after I installed No-script this stopped the freezes as long as I did not whitelist those static pages.
</p><p>If I do whitelist them the freeze will not occur every time but about once every two times I visit the site or move from one page on the site to another. What happens is that Firefox just shows its busy you can click nothing on the firefox page and the only way to exit is by using TaskManager to close Firefox.
</p><p>The only potential additional thing is that my hosts file is quite extensive in blocking tracking and advertising sites but until the Firefox updates of May this never posed a problem. The issue is getting frustrating as many sites simply dont function unless you allow their static page to run a script, it then becomes hit and miss for me to carry on browsing.

1244148,1545084467,addons no longer available,"<p>Hi:  I am trying to decide do I just totally give up on Firefox after all these years and move to Chrome or is there some logical path for addons planned/in process that I do not know about.
</p><p>It is like Firefox Management Team/Committee team made this technical decision with little understanding on the impact to the developers that had put in hard yards for years, or users who had been using these addons. I am at a loss when I try to understand why would they jeopardise so much.
</p><p>Since Firefox went to that ""new firefox"", sorry I dont know the technical lingo, most of the addons I use became unavailable. I have since written to each developer to ask, will they be upgrading their addon and the answer is NO. 
So basically Firefox is only useful to me if 
</p>
<ul><li> I stay in the old version on Mac Sierra OSX (55.0.3).  
</li><li> For the new windows 10 brand new laptop I tried also to create using the new Firefox and it was very unsuccessful as there are no addons even close to what I was using. 
</li></ul>
<p>For the Cookies controller there are some close but nothing as good as this addon in terms of how I used it -- manually removed cookies.
</p><p>On my Mac Firefox 55.0.3, I have the following addons  (all these have the LEGACY yellow highlight tag in the list)
</p><p>1 Cookie Controller
</p><p>2 Roomy Bookmarks Toolbar
</p><p>3 Session Manager
</p><p>4 New Add On Bar
</p><p>5 Add Bookmarks Here

</p><p>I installed the new Firefox on Windows 10 and after install the first thing I see it asking me for email... when I look closer it relates to Sync. This is most concerning to me.
</p><p>As it encourages newbies to sign up to Sync WITHOUT realising the risk of using sync. Please correct me if I am wrong, my understanding is 
- Firefox still has not made a notifier that sync is being used, when it is being used.
- In firefox we have no ability to turn OFF sync forever. Require a passcode to turn it ON.
</p><p>It is easier for someone to hack a computer and activate sync wihtout you knowing. It happened to me and I only realised when they tried to access my gmail account. And upon investigation I discovered they had turned Firefox Sync on.  So I dont want to use Firefox Sync ever.
</p><p>It happened to a few of my friends and they told me it was reported to firefox. But i dont see any evidence their feedback was taken on.
