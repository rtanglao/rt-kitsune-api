</p><p>Last year there was a topic about the same problem. They gave the following solution:
</p><p>""There is an easy fix for it just increase media.cache_readhead_limit to 9999 and media.cache_resume_treshold also to 9999. This was also puzzling me since firefox 54 would buffer till the end of the video but firefox 55 wouldn't, so I went trough the about:config and found those two lines once I chagned their values from (60, 30) to those above every single video I opened in firefox so far buffered till the end, you don't even need to restart the firefox just refresh the page for changes to take the effect. Hope this helped. ""
</p><p>Well, unfortunately, it did not work for me. I did all the changes in about:config as indicated, but I continue having the same problem. Any suggestions? Thanks for helping, Cheers

(September 5, 2018)","<p>I know this question has already been asked on the Mozilla Support Forums, but it's always better for there to be multiple answers to questions about Firefox since there's two sides to every story. I still am very much looking forward to reinstalling Firefox Stable on my 15.6"" full HD Dell Inspiron 7558 after I reset it and cleaned the drive a few days ago after numerous bug reports being sent to Mozilla and Microsoft about Firefox and Windows 10 build 17134, respectively. I'm also looking forward to the complete rollout of all of the major improvements to loading webpages in Firefox Stable, to be completed by Tuesday, January 29, 2019 when Firefox 65.0 Stable gets released to Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android. At that point in time, I'll be able to read and bookmark articles seamlessly and with much greater reliability than I do here today, September 5, 2018! Lastly, I'm very much looking forward to each and every one of the planned reliability improvements and new features coming in the Windows 10 October 2018 update which will be released next month. I always love Microsoft's concerted efforts to act upon the bug reports users worldwide send to Microsoft to make Windows better every second Tuesday of every month and when a new build of Windows 10 is released about once every six months! I'll comment on how Firefox Stable is working for me on my Dell Inspiron 7558 every four weeks beginning October 30. I'll also donate $5.00 to Mozilla every first and fifteenth of each month to ensure I always get timely updates to the bugs in Firefox Stable. Now more than ever, it's very important my experience with Firefox Stable, my much preferred web browser, is as seamless and reliable as it can be every day when I read all kinds of articles on the World Wide Web, especially about what there is to explore in the United States, Canada, and Mexico! My sister very much enjoyed Cancun after she became a registered nurse and I expect to have a substantially similar experience with her once I find a career that I very much enjoy working to help, not just support myself!
</p><p>I know I threw a lot at you this morning. This long description of how I feel at 10:26 AM EDT is evidence that I'm very compassionate about the active development of Firefox. On top of a $5.00 donation every first and fifteenth of each month, I might become a beta tester of Firefox and report any performance issue, real or perceived, to Mozilla as soon as I take notice of any that may be present!

I'm familiar with the fixes and have tried most. Private browsing seems to work best but I constantly have to reset options like graphs I use so that's a pain. If I zoom my screen in to say 80% some graphics wont load on a few webpages as well.
I was just reading about the issue in this support forum. Following on a point made I clicked the task manager tab (already opened) and for a sec it flashed ""81%"" ???? I tried it a few times with similar results.
I reduced the window to about 80% of the screen and put task manager on the side with a google search page and this tab open. Extensions,only adblocker plus.
</p><p>Just scrolling up/down this page causes the 2 FF background processes to go from near 0 up to 16 &amp; 18 (about) If I scroll up/down real fast I can get it to 100%. MPC-HC in the background is also causing Firefox CPU to be higher! If I pause music &amp; do nothing the FF processes all go down to 3 or to 0. Seems it may be something in the networking service host or maybe just some corruption. Will post back when I figure it out.

(see uploaded images) Frankly, I don't see the logic of it, but who knows why you guys do the things you do sometimes. However, it has obviously increased the size of the dialog box. Consequently, when I expand the menu to ""choose"" folders and such, the entire thing is running off the bottom of my screen and it does this because I have to use the Windows magnifier, and I have it locked to the task bar and so this ""screenshot"" that is now attached to the bookmark menu dialog box is pretty much cut-off as well while at the bottom I can barely view any of my folders.
</p><p>Even though I think it's a silly idea, it probably works fine for those who don't have to use the Windows magnifier, but for me--it's irritating and I wish to know how I can go in and remove the feature, plese.

Upon upgraded to Firefox Ver. 60.2.0esr (32-bit) yesterday, however, I can not find where they are any more.

Since I have been saving HTML backup files regularly, I tried to follow that procedure to make a new backup and it did get saved to my H/D with the content organized like all the earlier ones. I tried to import one of the earlier backups. It seemed to work. Yet, I could not find where did it go afterwards.
I do find some single level / linear listings of many URLs of sites that I visited previously under ""Other Bookmarks"". Most of them were a long time ago (I can even remember the subject.). Although I spotted some that are fairly recent (within the past month). But, surprisingly, one has triple identical entries. This is very puzzling.
Please provide some guidance.

It occurs with both a USB kbd and a wireless kbd.  Only CTRL held down continuously reduces the window Zoom.  No other key needs to be pressed.  Thus, can't use CTRL-+ to restore zoom, though I can click in address bar or use Zoom in the hamburger menu.  Another thing that happens is when a Print box gets to the point where it displays the printer name, it cycles rapidly through the list of printers, and it is impossible to change back to any other than the last on the list.  It's behaving as if some key were chronically on, but it is the same with the two different kbds.  Things work fine in Microsoft applications.  Just upgraded today to 62.0.  Tried re-loading the installer and doing a fresh install, as well as trying the Refresh suggested in Troubleshooting, but neither of these produced any change.  It's as if some kind of crazy kbd shortcut was installed without my knowing it, but I can't find anything that seems that it would behave this way.
Sorry, but there's no screen shot that can show this thing.
It's possible that I hit some kind of 3-key rollover thing that changed this behavior, but I have no idea what this would be, much less how to fix it.

1232411,1536203813,I detest Firefox Quantum. How can I go back to Firefox 29 - 56 ?,"<p>A pop-up appeared on my computer, asking me to install the latest upgrade to Firefox, stating that it was a “security upgrade”.  
</p><p>I installed it and found that I the whole appearance of Firefox had changed. 
</p><p>This new version is aesthetically disgusting with its sharp angles and black tabs, which are incredibly difficult to read. These tabs are now fixed at the top of the window, whereas I want them where I’ve always kept them, below the Bookmarks Toolbar. 
</p><p>I can’t put the tabs back where they belong, below the Bookmarks Toolbar, with Classic Theme Restorer because with this latest so-called “upgrade”,  Classic Theme Restorer is now “no longer compatible with my version of Firefox.”
</p><p>Why would anybody want tabs at the top of the window anyway ? It is now impossible to drag the Firefox window around my screen with the mouse as I’ve always done, and as I still do with any other window, because clicking and dragging on the tab at the top only creates a new duplicate Firefox window. 
</p><p>I’ve also lost other add-ons due to this so-called “upgrade” , including my regular FTP client, FireFTP and its associated FireFTP Button.
</p><p>I was happy with the way Firefox worked in the past: the Firefox I’m stuck wiyth now is an abomination.  I want to go back to the Firefox I had yesterday not this bullshit pretentious version I’ve been saddled with today.
</p><p>I want to return to Firefox 29 - 56 but of course, you won’t allow that. No one in the Firefox Empire is permitted to go back to what used to be !  
</p><p>I could possibly even accept that, if you’d bothered to inform us in your original pop-up that this was not just a security improvement but a full upgrade which, if accepted, would drastically alter Firefox on my computer.  Of course you didn’t say that, or anything like it. Your dishonesty is breath-taking.
</p><p>I’ve been using Firefox since the beginning: before that I was using the Mozilla browser. There used to be rhyme and reason to Firefox’s upgrades: now they just seem to be developments made for the sake of innovation, with no other reason. I’ve had a bellyful of the modern Firefox.  If you won’t let me change Firefox back to the way I want it, and always had it, I’ll just have to get rid of it.

1232475,1536244074,"How can I prevent two different versions of Firefox, which are supposed to be running two separate profiles, from interfering with each other?","<p>As you probably know, support for Firefox ESR 52 ran out yesterday.
</p><p>As you probably also know, Firefox 52 was the last version to support non-WebExtension addons, several of which I rely upon heavily for my work, such as Scrapbook.
</p><p>If your first reaction to that last statement ISN'T to suspect I haven't tried to find an alternative, then you can skip this paragraph. Otherwise read on. I have been searching for and evaluating alternatives ever since I heard for the first time that Scrapbook's days were numbered, but none of them offer adequate functionality. In order to work efficiently, I need to be able to archive and manage web pages, PDF files, images, MS Word files, notes and more in a folder tree structure directly within the browser UI, view archived content without an internet connection, use highlighting and commenting functions, use full-text search functions, and so on. In a nutshell, I need Scrapbook. If after reading this you still think there is a viable alternative that I missed, then I'm all ears.
</p><p>Doing without Scrapbook is not an option, but on the other hand, neither is surfing the web with what will soon be an outdated browser riddled with security flaws.
</p><p>For this reason, I decided to try a workaround that I read about some time ago: installing the 32-bit version of Firefox 52 ESR alongside the latest 64-bit version of the browser side-by-side, and using a different user profile for each. The idea was to use the up-to-date version of the browser for normal surfing, and to revert to the old version whenever it was necessary to use scrapbook.
</p><p>Well, at least it sounded good on paper. In practice I'm finding that using two different user profiles is by no means a guarantee that the two Firefox instances won't interfere with each other. I create a bookmark on the bookmarks toolbar in one instance; it shows up in the other instance. I delete it in one instance; it disappears in the other. Not even using the command line options -P ""Profile Name""  or -no-remote are helping.
</p><p>I really need to find a solution for this and any help would be greatly appreciated. Here are my questions summarized:
</p><p>1) Is there an alternative to Scrapbook that provides at least 90% of the same functionality? 
</p><p>2) Is there a way to have two versions of Firefox installed - 52 ESR 32-bit AND whatever the latest and greatest 64-bit is - and keep them completely separate from each other?
</p><p>3) Is there something else I'm missing?
</p><p>Thanks!

</p><p>I downloaded a fresh install of Firefox 62 this week, no issues setting it up, imported the HTML bookmark export file from Portable Firefox, no issues.
</p><p>Since the problems in 60 and 61, I now approach my bookmarks differently, I removed almost 3000 business bookmarks and now have them in a Word file, kept about 1000 active in FF.
</p><p>When I set up FF62 and imported from file, all my favicons were there in both sandboxed and unsandboxed Firefox (I use Sandboxie).
</p><p>Booted up this morning, all favicons are gone again, every single one of them.
</p><p>I have no issues with bookmark favicons in Portable Firefox, Slimjet (Chrome) or Waterfox - they all have identical counts and all favicons are present - just desktop Firefox and just since FF60.
</p><p>I have no issues with any of those browsers either sandboxed or unsandboxed either.
</p><p>I started with a completely fresh install, new profile, no bookmarks. When I downloaded and set up FF62, everything was great - I set up FF in an unsandboxed environment, always do.
</p><p>Portable Firefox, Portable Thunderbird and Thunderbird run flawlessly, I don't get it.
</p><p>What am I doing wrong?
</p><p>I am at a complete loss.
</p><p>Any ideas?
</p><p>Thanks, in advance.

Nowhere is the cause specified. There are no details of what behaviour or code on the site caused it to be listed, or who listed it, or why. Just a big message saying that this is a Deceptive Site. There's no one I can talk to about this, no way to find out any information whatsoever - there's not even any notification that the site has been blocked. All of which makes it just about impossible to actually FIX whatever is causing this issue (assuming that there is one, and I haven't just been reported randomly by some troll).
</p><p>So, to sum up: there's no useful information, no transparency and no accountability anywhere in this process. Just Google throwing their weight around and you letting them.
</p><p>I'm not saying that there is no problem - there may be a legitimate issue that needs addressing. What I'm saying is that the way the Mozilla Foundation has dealt with the problem makes it more or less impossible to actually do that addressing. Who exactly does that help?

Still after a few days FF slows down. The last time I decided to restart FF I clicked on File and waited 17 minutes for the drop down menu that let me click on Exit. 23 minutes later FF crashed. So whatever is going on in the background has to be involved with why this is happening. The FF interface by the way had been closed for about 20 minutes before I got the crash notice. This is not about running MBAM,buying a new machine or upgrading to the ESR. to fix the problem. It's academic. i want to know why because all the recommendations to upgrade in the past have not improved the situation and recent upgrades made things worse. I will be doing the ESR upgrade in time but I want to be able to launch this version as well perhaps as a different user.

Unfortunately, it does not give you the option to add an exception, which clears up the problem most of the time.
</p><p>Today this happened again with no ability to add an exception, and after looking at various websites for hours, trying to find a fix, I stumbled on one:  Having Firefox ""...automatically search for and import CAs that have been added to the Windows certificate store by a user or administrator.""  These are root certificates which you've manually imported.  If you understood that last sentence, then it means you've probably done it on your computer; I know I have.  The steps to fix it are these, and I cite the original web page further below:
</p><p>- Open a new window in Firefox and type ""about:config"" without the quotes and hit enter
- Confirm that you want to continue
- In the search field, type in security.enterprise_roots.enabled and hit enter - you'll be left with one field
- If it's marked as ""false"" then double-clicking it should turn it to ""true""
- Close the window, then go back to your Yahoo email login and try again.  For me, this worked *perfectly*!
</p><p>Here's the site where I found the info, under the ""Experimental Built-in Windows Support"" section:
<a href=""https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA:AddRootToFirefox"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA:AddRootToFirefox</a>

</p><p>maybe some more precisions:
</p><p>- win7 x64, with FF x64
</p><p>- the ""crashed"" profile has only been opened, not yet closed (I use hibernate so it wont be closed till I have an answer)
</p><p>- I use multiple profiles at once, and the update occured while opening a new profile AND running 2 other profiles
</p><p>- in ""sessionstore-backups"", I only have 2 files, ""recovery.baklz4"" and ""recovery.jsonlz4"", all with a ""Date modified"" AFTER the date of the upgrade
</p><p>- the settings of the ""crashed"" profile are as follow: ""restore old session -&gt; checked"", BUT, ""Clear history when Firefox closes has ALL checkboxes checked"".
</p><p><br>
This is the first time i encounter this bug since Quantum got out. With previous FF, there has ALWAYS been backup files.
I tried an undelete software, but it found NO deleted files in this folder, so I guess the files have been overwritten ...
</p><p><br>
I had like 29 tabs opened, and before this update, the restore session thing was perfectly working.
When the profile opened after the update, there was one page only, the one advertising about pocket (so ironic ^^).
</p><p><br>
What are my chances to recover my tabs ?
</p><p><br>
Bonus questions:
</p><p>- gnnn, why the lz4 thing on session files ? What soft should i use to get a FULL text version ? 7zip wont take it as an archive.
</p><p>- i'm on quantum right now but i'm fed up, it has been disappointments only. I'm using FF since v2 (15+ years), and it's like they killed my browser (apart from the perfs, i only LOST functionnalities). So, back to ESR very quickly, but is that a long-term solution (do not consider security, only websites compatibility) ?
</p><p>- Can i install ESR and quantum in parallel ? Are the profiles retro-compatible/cross-compatible ? I have 29 profiles, but not all of them have seen Quantum yet, so maybe I'm lucky.

</p><p>worked wonderfully for providing an automatic load of a *local* homepage in a new tab until FF v62.0.  I've checked my config file and js file, and both are correct and in the correct location, but now FF 62 broke this again.  Two questions: *WHY*, and how do I force this back to the *obvious* choice of wanting a new tab to load your homepage (including *LOCAL*, no-net-needed, no junk, fast loading pages).  No good explanation has ever been provided for why this simple functionality is forced away from users.  This is *obvious* functionality, why is there not a good explanation of why FF developers won't provide their users with this capability.

1232837,1536419041,Why should the Description Field be removed from Bookmarks?,"<p>Notice I didn't ask why IS it being removed.  That's already been explained, and there appears to be virtually zero support among users for the removal of this feature.  I have log-in information for almost a hundred websites stored in the Description Field in Bookmarks.  I've been reading that many others do as well.  Please understand that I appreciate volunteers taking the time to help users.  That's why I first read the Bugzilla report on this ""bug"" but I could find no evidence of how this solution doesn't cause more harm than good.  One reason for the feature's removal is that the extra coding needed to generate the Description Field is somehow burdensome on FireFox's efficiency.  No evidence is given for this, although I don't doubt it may reduce efficiency by an imperceptible amount.  Another claim is that very few people are taking advantage of the feature, while in the same breath admitting there was no way to actually know this!  
</p><p>I've used FireFox since its inception, and this is the first time I've felt compelled to find the secret handshake that takes me to the registration page so I could ask for support.  I understood when, for example, Quantum broke my ""DownThemAll!"" extension.  However, removing the Description Field feature appears to be a solution in search of a problem.

</p><p>There are solutions given on the Mac thread on how to use another companies add-on to show the past saved descriptions. They are still in the Mozilla data files but are not shown in Ver. 62.

This is what I did for the moment.

The upgrade has made my legacy add-on ""Backward/Forward History Dropdown"" dysfunctional.  That add-on displayed a dropdown arrow to the left of the location bar that listed the websites in the same window that I visited in the current browsing session, and enabled me to select a website in the list that I wanted to return to.  (That obviously was much easier than using the Back button to return to recently visited websites one by one.)  The only ways to do that now appear to be to pull down or right-click on the backward or forward indicators, but since I use an old trackpad it would be much more convenient to tap on a dropdown arrow as I used to do.
</p><p>After doing a bit of online research I created a chrome folder in my profile and then 3 subfolders named config, css, and image, along with 2 files called userChrome.css and userContent.css.  I then followed the instructions in this website:
</p><p><a href=""https://github.com/Aris-t2/CustomCSSforFx/releases"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Aris-t2/CustomCSSforFx/releases</a>
</p><p>I clicked on custom_css_for_fx_v2.0.5.zip and copied the contents of the folders and files into the ones in my chrome folder, except that I copied only one command from the userChrome.css file that looked like it might relate to my issue.  In addition, I copied some script I found elsewhere that made my tab toolbar disappear, since I don't use tabs.  My tab toolbar has disappeared as I wanted, but my backward/forward buttons haven't changed at all and still don't show a dropdown history marker.  The contents of my userChrome.css file are as follows:
</p>
<pre>#tabbrowser-tabs {
visibility: collapse !important;
}

1232914,1536447006,Change scrollbars Tor Browser 8 (Fx 60.2.0ESR) _userChrome still work?,"<p>Tor Browser 8.0_Linux x64 (uses Firefox 60.2.0esr) made a lot of changes to scrollbars &amp; a few other UI objects.
TBB 8.0 doesn't pick up the active Linux theme elements.  I'm not sure if it ever did, but some things in v8.0 don't suit my needs.  I'm wondering why it doesn't pick up the system theme.
</p><p>Regular Linux Firefox 60.1.0ESR uses the system theme - either native ones from the distro, or custom themes.
So it appears it's NOT just because the theme(s) contain code that Fx Quantum can't use.  Right off, I don't see anything that regular Fx 60.1 ESR isn't using from the active system theme.  
</p><p>AFAIK, there is no change for namespace lines in CSS files from before and after Fx 57.
I made no changes to the system theme after installing Fx 60.1ESR, to make it work.
Apparently, no one on the official Tor  mailing list has any ideas why TBB wouldn't use the system theme.  
</p><p>TBB 8 / Fx 60.2.0 ESR has a /Browser/gtk2/<a href=""http://libmozgtk.so"" rel=""nofollow"">libmozgtk.so</a> file, that appears to control some of the UI, <b>but so does regular Fx 60.1 ESR, </b>and it doesn't ignore the system theme.  The TBB  <a href=""http://libmozgtk.so"" rel=""nofollow"">libmozgtk.so</a> file is larger than the version in regular Fx.
</p><p>Nothing  jumped out for differences in about:config, searching ""theme"" between the TBB version vs. the version from Mozilla.
</p><p>2) Besides TBB 8.0 ignoring the system theme &amp; so far not using code from userChrome that worked in Linux in all regular Fx versions &lt; 57,  Frank Lion says most of old UI css code for pre Firefox 57 will still work for Fx 57+, but some may not.  Again, Firefox 60.1esr (linux) just uses the system theme - including customized scrollbars &amp; sliders.  
The(clean) profile for Fx 60.1esr has no userChrome.css file.  
</p><p>But Fx 60.1esr DOES have a /gtk2/<a href=""http://libmozgtk.so"" rel=""nofollow"">libmozgtk.so</a> file and <b>still uses the system theme.</b> If I wanted to further customize objects in regular Fx 57+, I COULD add a userChrome.css, as I did pre-v57.   Generally, I didn't have problems customizing say, scrollbars, using userChrome.css, even though the system theme also had custom code for scrollbars.

I think it would be a good idea to put another option under ""Default Search Engine

to have the option of making the default search engine for the search bar different from the default search engine for the address bar.
As of right now you have two search bars that use the same search engine by default and waiting for the drop down to appear to change the search engine for the search bar is a pain in the ass.

You must setup a security device (""MFA, ""2FA"") for your Firefox Account in order to access this service. Please setup a security device, then try logging in again.
If you have just setup your security device and you see this message, please log out of Firefox Accounts (click the ""Sign out"" button), then log back in.
</p><p>This makes no sense to me honestly, and I was hoping that someone could explain this message to me??

Browsed internet, learned of Bookmarkdupes (with the 2 stars). Installed, cleaned out bookmarks, and started over building a bookmarks menu. Via Sync, apparently, laptop then had the new bookmark set, as did mobile devices. Some couple of weeks later, while using laptop, bookmarks started duplicating again. From about 100 bookmarks, I wound up with over 4,750. Then, that synced to my desktop and mobile devices. How do I stop the duplicating. Again, browsing the web, some support pages pop up which seem to address the issue. I have already done the Verify Integrity suggestion. But what is Firefox Quantum, what is Foxmarks, now Xmarks. References to those and suggestion don't use Sync. Sync is valuable if you have multiple devices, but worthless if you have to turn it off.

1233066,1536544919,YouTube Default view ON FIREFOX is changed so it's practically the same as Theater mode.  How do I get the old default view back?,"<p>YouTube Default view used to show the video on the left, with the Up Next thumbnails in a column on the right.  (If a playlist was selected, it would appear at the head of the right-hand column with the Up Next thumbnails below it.)  Comments appeared below the video.  
On three other browsers (Chrome, Opera and Vivaldi) YouTube Default view remains the same as before, but ON FIREFOX it's changed to something quite different.  In the new Default view the video stretches horizontally all the way across the screen.  The height is increased proportionately, and on my laptop that means that the video won't fit on the screen heightwise -- what a nuisance, I have to scroll to see the upper and lower parts of the video image: I can't see the whole thing a once. The contents of the (old view) right-hand column now appear below the video, and Comments appear below that.  To get to Comments I have to scroll, scroll, scroll.  It is an ungainly and  confusing layout.
Peculiarly, the new Default view layout is practically the same as the Theater mode.  Th only difference I see is that in the new Default view the panel above the video has a white background, whereas the in the Theater mode that panel has a black background.  Now there's a useful feature!
I never had any use for YouTube Theater mode. I would use either the (old, user-friendly) Default view or Full Screen.  Why duplicate Theater mode features and then replace Default view with them?
</p><p>I assume that this is a Firefox problem because the old Default view still appears on other browsers. I want  it back on FIREFOX!  How do I do it?
</p><p>BTW I meant to attach screenshots comparing the two views, but the upload didn't seem to be working.

This popup is accompanied by a second popup that advertises Mac Mechanic. Although this second popup has a red dot top left, this is not live. Clicking on the red dot would lead me to the same location as clicking anywhere else on this second popup.
The only way I can remove the popups and silence the spoken recorded message is to ""Force Quit"" Firefox. 
Can you please build something into Firefox that identifies the source and type of all popups so:
(a) Firefox users can close them simply with the cursor, and 
(b) Firefox users can block them and prevent them from depositing any malware on our laptops.

Присутствует проблема с вкладками отображаемыми на ленте вкладок. Firefox не запоминает позицию вкладки на ленте. Предположим у нас открыто много вкладок, большее количество чем возможно отобразить на панели, например в два раза, и присутствует стрелки скроллинга вкладок. Активная вкладка находится посередине панели, на вкладке воспроизводиться видео из Youtube. Теперь если мы нажмем кнопку развернуть видео на весь экран, а потом выйти из полноэкранного режима, то активная вкладка не останется на своем бывшем месте т.е. по середине ленты, а будет отображаться в крайнем правом углу лены вкладок. Т.е. произойдёт скроллинг ленты без действий пользователя. И активная вкладка поменяет место отображения на экране.

This may be a dumb question but would reseting my windows version to 9th, September help? I mean it would erase the update i did for Firefox and should (as much as i know &lt;.&lt;) also reset the setting for Firefox to yesterday's ones correct?

I got randomly bounced up to version 61 of firefox last night and I've decided— for now— to stick with it since it seems just the same as version 58, which I was using prior. But this is still an odd development to say the least. Can  anyone help?

I'm running Firefox (both Quantum/Beta and main stable versions tested) on
macOS Mojave (newest Beta). The behavior is the same - after File dialog is
opened, I can do few actions (e.g. browse few folders, even successfully
save) but if I leave it open too long, it stops responding causing the
entire Firefox to freeze.
</p><p>Note that I can save or select a file as long as it is done quickly -
""save as ..."", then select folder from list of the recent ones and click
save. But if you start browsing or creating new folder, or changing file
name - it all freezes.
</p><p>The freezing happens regardless of website or whether it is “save” from
Firefox menu or from a web app (eg Google Mail - saving attachment).

1233398,1536708411,Something starts happening after two hours or so on Firefox - WHAT IS IT?,"<p>For over a year now, I have experienced the 'phenomenon' that after between two and three hours of browsing, the whole of Firefox just grinds to a halt.  I have tried all the various suggestions but nothing works.
</p><p>I have a large number of tabs, because they are all regularly used in my family history research,  I am moving between web sites all the time to gain information, capture screen shots from Trove, and update data on Ancestry and MyHeritage, particularly,  I am also switching to other programs regularly, e.g. Photoshop Elements, Excel and Word.
</p><p>As a retired programmer, and amateur web site developer, I am wondering whether the browser is doing some activity such as indexing across all tabs, or refreshing of all tabs, after two hours - if so I am seeking some way  to disable this activity, which I don't want to happen, because it is just annoying and wasting precious time in a life timetable which is rapidly coming near to its end.
</p><p>Along similar lines of frustration I am also experiencing that if I leave the browser open and go away to have a meal (for maybe 1 to 2 hours or even sometimes as little as 10 to 15 minutes) it is nearly never possible to get Firefox to just start up again when I go to access a tab in the session that I left open.  Very often Firefox crashes in such situations, while on other occasions it just takes maybe as much as half an hour for it to get back up to pace, so to say. 
</p><p>Again - Is Firefox doing some background tasks?  I do not want Firefox to do any background tasks of ANY KIND.  I simply want a browser that shows me the page when I request it and then leaves it alone, no automatic refreshing, no indexing, no nothing -  simple page display.  I only want refreshing when I ask for it.
</p><p>Finally, this last point is maybe Firefox related, maybe Ancestry related, maybe OS related, I am not sure, but again it is something to do with Firefox not doing the basics, but seemingly doing lots of other things that I do not want it to do.  Often when I add information to a record that is open on a tab in Ancestry, the re-display of the tab, with the updated information, does not come back up with its proper name, e.g. ""Philip Mark Hunt"", instead it just comes up as ""Ancestry Person"".  It is as though the reloading of the tab has hit some kind of timeout, so it just defaults to a general name rather than the true tab name.

I log in manually repeatedly, and I'm not offered to save it, and It isn't found in ""Saved Logins"". I'd sure like to have Firefox remember that login. How can I do that? It is my understanding that a website can be set up to NOT let the browser login saving work. Maybe that's what's going on here? But is there some way to force that login to be saved? Or some way to edit that information into the ""Saved Logins"" file?

1233412,1536720460,Addons / Extensions / Plugins Safety,"<p>I have always been a firm believer in an addon-free life. I avoid third-party addons like the plague because I've always been paranoid of their capabilities of stealing data and sharing sensitive information.
</p><p>But I'm starting to really get tired of ads, and after looking at some plugins available, I've decided I need to make certain aspects of my browser easier to use. OneTab for example is looking like something that would reduce a lot of headache in my life.
</p><p>I decided to check up on Mozilla and their advice regarding addon safety, and came across this page:
<a href=""https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2018/02/01/understanding-extension-permission-requests/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2018/02/01/understanding-extension-permission-requests/</a>
</p><p>and on that page, I came across this part of the article:
</p>
<hr>
<p>How do I stay safe?
While there is an element of risk to installing any third-party software, there are a few simple best practices you can follow to reduce it. Is the extension made by a reputable developer? Are the user ratings high? Are the permission requests consistent with the features of the extension?
</p>
<hr>
<p>I have a bone to pick with this guideline or, ""best practice"".
</p><p>Is the extension made by a reputable developer? Are the user ratings high?
</p><p>First of all, does the fact that a reputable developer made the addon have any bearing on whether the addon is safe?
</p><p>And second of all, the reputation of the developer is directly influenced by the user-ratings a developer's addon/s receive.
</p><p>Google and Facebook are both majorly reputable companies, and they sell your data like Lemonade on a summer's day.
</p><p>More importantly, user-ratings are only an indication of how well the advertised functions of the addon work. And I bet any addon developer who is developing an addon to do dirty work in the background, is definitely going to make sure that the advertised functions of the addon are in proper working order.
</p><p>Another issue here is that, user-ratings consist primarily of users....The average Joe, not by security researchers, or even developers/coders. Does the average Joe really leave a user rating behind based on how safe he thinks the addon is?
</p><p>Just a thought. Telling people that a ""best practice"" for determining the safety of an addon should factor in the user-rating seems a little misleading.
</p><p>Regardless though, can Firefox not have a function that tells you what kind of info an addon is passing over the internet?

1233417,1536724170,Will Firefox EVER have a skin equivalent to Walnut 2?,"<p>I started using the original Firefox (nee Mozilla in a browser &amp; email package) when it was first publicly available.  And have used it in my university classrooms and personally many years.  Now, I am looking for an alternative that can give a) the common functions in today's browsers and b) the ""skin"" add-on Walnut 2.  The current Walnut 2 imitations are, simply, just pathetic.  So, I pose the question: Will Firefox EVER have a skin equivalent to Walnut 2?   A followi-on question: Has the author of Walnut 2 ever been asked to participate in Firefox?

1233419,1536726412,UN-ZOOM the browser (Mac),"<p>Hello.
</p><p>A lot of times, I will accidentally 'blow-up' the browser to full-screen size while moving the mouse around, equal to intentionally hitting the 'green' traffic light circled button, or using the Firefox pull-down menu 'WINDOW &gt; ZOOM.'  
</p><p>This is a hassle in Mac when done accidentally, because then I have to make the tom menu bar appear by swiping down and up, then manually drag the corner of the active window to reduce the window size.  It also upsets my pre-set, preferred size of the window (critical for professional film/tv editors who usually work on dual, 24 to 30-inch screens; where a full Firefox window is way too big for e-mails, surfing the web, and other tasks).
</p><p>I can't believe there is no ""Un-zoom"" keystroke (way easier than mousing to a pull-down menu) to return the Firefox window to the size I had set it to!
</p><p>Please consider adding this.
</p><p>Thank you for your valuable time!

1233425,1536729582,Firefox 62.0 no longer lets our PC web cameras take pictures. Thoughts?,"<p>We are a small organization and have an app that must use FF for all app features to function correctly. Our workstations (PC desktops) have Logitech cameras installed via USB 2.0.
</p><p>Before the FF 62.0 update, our cameras would allow us to go into the app and take/save a picture. However, after the update, the camera feature will not fully load on any workstations (it just displays a white screen background).
</p><p>We tested this in Chrome and can confirm that the app lets you take/save pictures with no problem. But we need the cameras to work in FF for full app functionality.
</p><p>Any guidance on how to resolve this bug within FF? The camera drivers are up-to-date and we even uninstalled/reinstalled with no success. We believe something in the last FF 62.0 update triggered this problem, but need a workaround or resolution.
</p><p>Thanks!

1233426,1536731447,I had ro reset my Firefox password and now years of bookmarks are gone. What was the point of creating an account?,"<p>As it says. I gave you info with the understanding that my bookmarks were protected. You did not hold up on your end of the bargain. You basically stole my personal info since I got nothing in return for giving it to you. Firefox was always my go to browser and I always recommended it. Not it is just a dumpster fire. I lost some very important info. I will never come back.

1233428,1536734452,How do firefox consider a URL as tracker,"<p>I have been looking into the latest announcement of mozilla regarding tracking prevention. I can see that mozilla is trying what apple is trying with Safari ITP. 
The technical details describe that firefox checks the given URL in blacklist and then it checks if same URL is available in entity whitelist.  If it s in blacklist and not in whitelist , it is treated as tracker . 
</p><p>My question here is how(on what basis) a URL is classified as blacklist / whitelist up front. 
What if a new website is created with tracking abilities . How will mozilla classify it is a tracker since it is new and will not be available on both blacklist URL list and whitelist's...
