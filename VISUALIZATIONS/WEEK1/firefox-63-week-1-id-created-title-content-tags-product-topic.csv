</p><p>In Firefox 63 the option to never check for updates was removed. The release notes suggest to create a policies.json to disable updates. This does not result in similar behaviour! It does indeed stop the checks for updates, but it also disables the option of manually checking for updates. So this is not the same!
</p><p>I'd like to know how I can disable the auto checking for updates, but keep the option to manually check and update.

And only if I then click to confirm that I indeed want to update, it starts downloading said update and installing it. This is what I want back please. How do I make that happen? Thanks.

He has Windows 7, Firefox 63, and I'm trying to get it to stop updating because every time it does, it resets things - lately it's been asking him for his Firefox password, but he doesn't use any server-based Firefox features, so it's only causing confusion.  He does NOT need to log onto Firefox sync. 
</p><p>While I was fixing his settings, I noticed he had his home page set to Facebook, whereas previously, I had set it to the Firefox default for him (""New Tab"" still uses the default Firefox page).  When I clicked on the dropdown to change from ""Custom URLs"", nothing dropped down, and I was unable to change the home page.  Eventually, I reset all of his settings to default and restarted.  Then he told me he actually did want Facebook for his home page, and now I couldn't set it back - clicking on the dropdown to change from ""Default"", again, nothing dropped down.  I googled and found another way to change the home page by dragging a tab to the house icon on the page, and that worked, but I do not understand why I am not able to change the home page setting using the options page.
</p><p>Note: I have been fiddling with adding a policies.json file to try to prevent unwanted prompts for Firefox sync password and unwanted prompts for updating the browser.  On the thought that that might have been causing a problem, I removed the line that disables update checks, but that didn't make any difference.

When attempting to change my theme in the customize window, mousing over the Default theme does show the proper colors for it, but selecting it still shows the Dark theme colors. I tried examining my Add-ons manager, where it shows that I am still using the Default theme, despite the colors clearly belonging to the Dark theme. I can freely change to the Light theme without issue, but for some reason, the Default one refuses to load properly. I have since tried uninstalling all my Add-ons, deleting my profiles, and uninstalling Firefox before restarting my computer, but to no avail. The Add-on I was examining initially was the Dark Night Mode add-on. Examining the page info, it does say it is not perfect, and their home page says that there are complex issues with getting it to work with Firefox, but I was unable to find more information on this offhand, nor any descriptions of scenarios like mine. I believe the initial settings for my Default theme came from some setting based off my color scheme I have set for my computer themes in general, based off my background, but I was unable to find more information on this at the time. The screenshots I am including are of my Add-on manager showing that I am using the default theme, the customize menu showing the Default theme when highlighted in the drop down menu to change it, and the result that displays when the Default theme is selected. Any ideas on why this issue is occurring, and how to fix it, would be appreciated.

after updating my FF from 62.03 to 63.0, I experience a strange behaviour. I use the css properties ""display:none""  and ""display:table-cell"" to dynamically show and hide table columns. Prior to FF 63.0 everything worked excellent. But now, after hiding columns (by altering the css property form ""display:table-cell"" to ""display:none""), the table and its content is displayed properly but some of the cells are missing their defined background colour. As soon as doing some action which forces a redraw of the window (e.g. resize the window or scroll the window), the complete table is diplayed properly . In order to give an impression feel free to have a look at the attached images Pre-Collapsed-Table.png, Collapsed-Table.png and Expected-Collapsed-Table.png. Meanwhile I have been playing with the ""visibility"" attribute in order to get the desired result. Unfortunately this is not suitable because hidden elements take up space on the page.
</p><p>Is it a bug in FF 63.0? What can I do to get the previous and expected behaviour? Any ideas?

Color primaries: BT.709.

</p><p>Since the most recent update I am experiencing problems in being able to save pictures. I find an image in Google Image Search, click on it and go to save .... however it does not save. The process even prompts me to select the folder I want it saved in, the name I want to give the file and so on. I do all of these things - but there is no picture there when I go to the folder. I have tried saving to different folders but no luck. This does not happen in all cases, only on some pictures.
</p><p>I find the only way i can save the picture is to click on View Image and then prompt it to save. However as my work involves finding lots of images online, this is adding several steps to the process.

</p><p>since the last update (v63.0, Windows) I have an issue that makes Firefox not usable. I hope you can help me.
</p><p>Every time I open a new webpage, over a hyperlink or manually, Firefox takes 5-8 seconds until it starts to load the page. It seems like Firefox does nearly nothing at this point, there is no traffic going out, no CPU usage etc. There is also no status message in the bottom left corner like ""Waiting for <a href=""https://foobar.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://foobar.com</a>..."". After 5-8 seconds Firefox starts to load the page and then it goes very fast.
This makes it impossible to use Firefox, because normal activities take a lot of time, because every click takes 5-8 seconds. On chrome on the same PC everything is OK.
</p><p>I already did nearly everything to reset and clear my Firefox installation, I reinstalled and deleted the Mozilla folder in the AppData directory, the problem still persists. My colleague has the same issue since this update, so it's not only my PC.

As website owner my convern comes after mozilla is blocking tracking by default meaning that google ads cannot be served by default, only if users will choose so. Most of the mozilla users don't even know what tracking means, so the chances of choosing to allow tracking and serve ads are very low.
Many websites owners use adsense ads to pay for their servers/hosting, their hard work, etc. and as you know every visitors is comsuming resources and bandwidth, so my questions is: Why webmasters shouldn't block mozilla users since the chances to generate revenue thru ads is very low, to none?
I get that it's a great feature to the user, but should be an option rather than a default setting?
If webmasters choose to block mozilla users, there will be a lot of users who can't access a specific information and they don't even know the cause.

</p><pre>and it has not happened again since. It seem's that the newest update to Windows 10 makes it so it restarts any application that wasn't shut down for, if you restart or shutdown your PC. It must have thought I hadn't closed my browser each time, even though I am certain I did. 
</pre>
<p>It started doing it yesterday. Each time I start up my computer, it opens up Firefox to a new tab. It is not on the startup list in my task manager, and I just can't seem to make it stop. 
</p><p>If anyone have any advice on this, it would be greatly appreciated. I don't like it when my computer does stuff I haven't told it to do.

1238393,1540578235,Firefox suddenly closes when minimized,"<p>When I minimize Firefox it closes completely and I am not able to return to the tabs I had opened. I have to start completely over. This is hindering my research and writing in a huge way!!! I saw in another post that it always does that, but that is not true. I have been using it for years this way and have never had a problem. It just started closing upon minimization this morning. How do I get it back to how it was? I will have to use a different browser if there is no fix for this and I really don't want to do that.
I should also add that Firefox had been pinned to my taskbar. This morning it was gone and I had to re-pin it there. But it doesn't matter whether I open it from the taskbar or from the menu, it shuts down when I minimize. 
Please help!
I also just noticed that even if I don't minimize it, if I do anything else on my computer it closes and I have to completely restart it. I absolutely can't work this way. For example, if I leave it open and then open my Word document, when I try to go back to Firefox it has closed and has to re-start. All the information I just researched is gone. I'm very, very frustrated.

</p><p>1. Do I need to clear existing cookies to remove the myriad of sites already tracking me before turning on tracking protection? Or, will turning it on do an immediate filter on my existing cookies?  
</p><p>2. Will turning off tracking stop sites that I want to retain login information for from retaining the ""login"" cookie infor i.e. are we close to a full ""cookie block"" with anti-tracking? Or does FFox have some creative algorithm (or list) that allows it to distinguish between tracking cookies and less offensive cookies? Concurrently, is there a way to allow a ""tracking cookie"" if I need it to retain information for a site I'm comfortable with?
</p><p>3. One specific tracking question:  Will eliminating tracking cookies stop (specifically) Google's cross site advertising, where you look at a product on site A (who shares that info via google) and then a little later google's advertising mechanism pops up those products when you're at site B?

</p><p>Switching to FireFox Quantum v. 63.0 from Safari v. 12 because FireFox application is said to be (from multiple forum discussions) better able to integrate and successfully employ a Zotero citation management utility extension.
</p><p>However, after FireFox download completed, but application not yet installed, user looked for Zotero Firefox extension (plug-in), finding relevant information at only one Mozilla site:
</p><p><a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/zotero-bib-autoexport/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/zotero-bib-autoexport/</a>
</p><p>The Mozilla info screen for ""Zotero Autoexporting"" displayed ""Not compatible with FireFox Quantum"".
</p><p>I have either asked the wrong question about or looked in the wrong place for a functional extension of the Zotero utility and its use with Firefox Quantum and LibreOffice, or FireFox Quantum does not support a usable LibreOffice Zotero extension or connector (I do not know the difference between these two).
</p><p>Having downloaded FireFox Quantum following many, many attempts to configure these named applications / to download the correct application versions / to correctly configure the applications / to troubleshoot incorporating PubMed bibliographic citations using Zotero into LibreOffice 6.1.2.1 documents, to finally read that the Zotero extension is  ""Not compatible with FireFox Quantum"" is massively frustrating.
</p><p>Here is what I want to do:
</p><p>Use the browser Firefox Quantum.  Install into FireFox Quantum an auto-downloading Zotero extension.  Perform PubMed searches. Use Pubmed resources to save searches in a format Zotero can import.  Use Zotero to import and manipulate PubMed-Zotero compatible search results.  Incorporate search results from Zotero into LibreOffice Writer documents.
</p><p>Is this too much to ask?

After reading from various malware forums it appears that <a href=""http://cnhv.co"" rel=""nofollow"">cnhv.co</a> has links to crypto mining software and as well as the notorious <a href=""http://conhive.com"" rel=""nofollow"">conhive.com</a>. Firefox does not attempt to connect to any other website apart from <a href=""http://cnhv.co"" rel=""nofollow"">cnhv.co</a>. When firefox starts on my laptop it creates 4 processes. One parent/main process and 3 child processes. All the 3 processes try to connect to <a href=""http://cnhv.co"" rel=""nofollow"">cnhv.co</a> website. Starting the firefox in safe mode or after resetting it still leads to the same behaviour. Only firefox exhibits this behaviour when I try to launch it and when I shut it down. Other browsers do not. 
</p><p>So my question is as follows
1) How do I determine which process or what setting or the location of the infection that is causing Firefox to connect to <a href=""http://cnhv.co?"" rel=""nofollow"">cnhv.co?</a>
2) How do I fix this? How do I clean Firefox such that it does not connect to any crypto website at startup and shutdown?

When I double click in the top bar of the firefox browser, any open windows are put away, not closed...which destroys the link, but put away like clicking on the minus sign in the upper right blue bar that is next to the ""fill page"" icon and the red X that destroys the link.
This may be a property of MS8.1 POS or it might be Firefox. I am sick and tired of having to open all these windows one by one each time my finger ""stutters"" producing a rapid double click. I have tried changing single click and double click response delays, but that does not help either. The morons that wrote MS8.1 load the keystrokes instantly without checking timing. 
Also, does anyone know of an operating system that emulates the MS NT system without all the F------ ""features"" that pervade later OSes??? Many Thanks for your suggestions!!!

</p><p>this wasn't a problem with firefox until quantum was introduced, and from what i hear about the firefox quantum the addon handling was changed to disallow addons access to specific browser system files that some addons were  using that caused firefox to crash,
</p><p>feel free to correct me if i'm wrong but “Once you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.” iv eliminated all the other probable causes and the changes to the addon handling is all that remains

</p><p>In the last year or two, key features that always made it a winner have slowly been disappearing, and now it has gotten to the point that it is actually barely any better than IE11, and no different than Chrome. Why? Big reason is now addons don't work, or can't work the way they used to/need to, but it goes beyond that.
</p><p>1. I can no longer have my homepage open, when I load a new tab. This is absolutely mind boggling, even internet explorer can do that! NOTE: My homepage is a webpage saved on my harddrive that I made that gives me quick access to everything I need to do for work. I used to be able to load it natively, then it became something that required an add-on, and now it is completely broken, and impossible to do.
</p><p>2. Devs clearly don't understand the concept of a PROXY. Lots of people (i.e. in corporate environments) have everything go through a proxy. I can't even use the firefox installer anymore (as I discovered yesterday) because it requires a direct connection to the internet.
</p><p>3. Speaking of Proxy issues, when I open firefox, it immediately needs to connect to the internet, resulting in proxy authentication pop-ups. These used to be Auto-accepted with the addon AUTO-AUTH, however with the new web API crap this apparently isn't possible. There are settings in firefox that are supposed to auto-accept proxy-logins, but they don't work. So - I'm stuck hitting enter every single time I open the bloody program. There is no way to delay or stop firefox from automatically trying to connect to the internet which is also stupid.
</p><p>4. I could go on, but what's the point... the Devs don't care. Time to go back to FF v51 or whatever version it was before things went so wrong and hang on to that, with my windows 7 installation. Sigh.

As far as I can tell I can't tell Firefox, when starting, to make sure the Ask to save logins and passwords for websites is checked but could such a thing be possible?  This would allow me to add a command line when I start firefox on startup.  How about ""Ask to save logins and passwords for websites = 1"" or, say, add a line like that to the profile page?

</p><p>Everything was just fine until Firefox did this...again. My links were where they were supposed to be. This isn't the first time a Firefox update has lost links for me. I won't do it again. I'll go to Chrome because I can't take this anymore.

Please tell me this is doable or I am going to just start crying.

1238757,1540862633,"Firefox print scale (size percentage) is stuck at 30% for all printing in Firefox, can't change it.","<p>I've used Firefox as my default browser for years on my PC (Windows 10), never had this problem:  Two days ago everything I printed from Firefox started printing in tiny print. After sleuthing, I found that my default print scale size (as seen in the Print Preview window) had defaulted to 30% (I normally leave it at Shrink to Fit). And even the title of that percent window changed from ""Scale"" to ""ShrinktoFit"". 
</p><p>The problem is that I can't change it out of 30%! When I choose another percent or Shrink to Fit in that Print Preview window (as I've always done for years when I want to change the print size for a particular job), it doesn't hold; next print job it's right back to 30% and tiny print.
</p><p>I went to the Firefox ""How to fix printing problems"" page and followed all the instructions (including the about:config fix), I have restarted Firefox multiple times including in Safe Mode (with all Add-ons disabled), I finally uninstalled Firefox completely on my PC and then downloaded and reinstalled it again, but still the print size is stuck at 30%. And that's for anywhere and anything I print on the internet in Firefox (my Yahoo email, any and all web pages, etc).  I tried downloading Chrome and printing the same test web pages from Chrome and they come out fine. So it appears to be some glitch with Firefox on my PC.
</p><p>Any ideas what's wrong?

It doesn’t show all the old folders and is difficult to make new folders.
And what/where is the “library”? And who cares?
The old version worked just fine.
I wish every time one of you techies come back from the bathroom with some new idea that you’d just keep it to yourself!
Obfuscation and more clicks is NOT GOOD PROGRAMING!!!
Also – screen popup does not adjust to screen on laptop – “done” button hidden behind taskbar.
And the graphics/info space on top (of the bookmark save dropdown Ctrl D) is wasted and not useful and takes up too much space/real estate.

But my selecting ""just"" ""Firefox"" from the drop-down list of available PDF default viewers does not ""stick""--the PDF viewer always remains ""Edge""--even though FF is set as the general default browser. The same problem was occurring when Acrobat Reader DC was on the computer and it was the default for PDF's--so I entirely removed that app, but now I get (MS's built-in) Edge as the PDF default but not FF. Changing file associations, etc. just does not have any effect! I am using the current versions of FF and Windows 10 Pro.
