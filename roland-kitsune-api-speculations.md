1. found out about this API via ace volunteer's code for [myq.html](https://github.com/jscher2000/My-SuMo-Questions/blob/master/myq.html)
1. there are no docs on readthedocs (there are docs for the very limited v1 API, this is the v2 API)
1. i believe this API was implemented for BuddyUp
1. most of the API is normal django so if you know django you can figure it out, i don't know django
1. i believe mythmon and others worked on this API
1. i believe there is a url parameter just to get modified questions and answers, not just the ones creatd
1. to make the API practical in production there needs to be a way to ask for items from a particular time period and fortunately there's an open github issue for that :-)
