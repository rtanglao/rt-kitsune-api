1209031,1520956900,Firefox passwords lost following a Reset,"<p>Hello,
Firefox has 'lost' my passwords following a reset.  The reset was 'recomended' by FF because it was slow starting.
I use a master password on the passwords file.
</p><p>I've tried to follow some standard solutions to the problem but:
1) There is no ""Old Firefox"" folder - neither on my desktop, nor elsewhere.
</p><p>2) Either FF did not create a new profile, or it replaced the old one.
Given the age of the timestamps in the folder, I think it did not create a new folder.
</p><p>I have, manually, created a new profile folder.
</p><p>3) I have found 'key3.db'. 'key4.db' and 'logins.json', and copied them to my new profile folder.
</p><p>logins.json seems to contain old pasword info, but the info encrypted.  New passwords appear to be added to the file as usual and displayed, but old ones are not being displayed or used.

1209044,1520961233,Some problems with downloading files..,"<p>First of all, I want to say that I've been using Firefox for about 11 years now and it's been great, but recently some problems with downloads made me consider switching to another browser, which I would rather avoid.
</p><p>The issue pretty much boils down to two problems.
</p><p>1) When downloading a file, more often than not, Firefox downloads the file as 'latest' or as a really long string of digits, letters and other characters (4XU4fQXvJ1TicU2W8aco_=... for example). I have not been able to track on which sites this happens, but I'd say it's probably a 60% chance of it happening, with Firefox having 'off-days', where this happens all the time.
</p><p>2) This one is a bit more recent and started about a week ago. A lot of time when I'm downloading, the browser saves a file to my default location despite me selecting otherwise. The standard window pops up, I select 'Save File To', choose a directory (the desktop for example) and save it. Despite this, the browser saves the file to my D: drive, which is selected as the default (see picture).
</p><p>I really hope these issues can be fixed, as I'd hate to switch to another browser.

</p><p>Video has stopped working properly Firefox after the update to version 59, 64 bit I had probems after the previous update, but eventually I resolved it by creating a new profile.  I have tried everything since the last update, reset, reinstall, safe mode, new profile, performance settings etc.
</p><p>I have two Windows 10 computers (ASUS Laptop Home edition and Toshiba Laptop Pro edition). As this has occurred on two different laptops I am fairly sure this is a FF problem that Mozilla will have to fix. The latest update has only caused the problem on the ASUS, the Toshiba is fine so far . 
</p><p>This must be escalated and solved by Mozilla. I am not the only one with these or other problems. I cannot and will not accept that ever time there is an update to FF that I have to spend hours resolving problems and in the latest case not even succeeding. Mozilla's reputation has already been damaged by this and other problems. Is it caused by the 64 bit version? If so we must be allowd to revert fully to the 32 bit version and continue with normal updates to that version. Mozilla is becoming like Microsoft, i.e. unreliable and unacceptable. I am already using Edge more than FF and if the problems continue I will reluctantly permanently uninstall FF, which would be a shame after 10 years of generally vdery good service.

1209267,1521063790,Passwords are not secure with master password,"<p>I'm cross-posting this in the desktop version forums since it applies for both mobile and desktop.
</p><p>I really don't understand what is the logic behind the way the password manager was implemented, and it's a major no-go for me. The purpose of a master password should be that it is asked EACH time you try to show the passwords in plain text (in the settings), not once per session (which is also very annoying since the purpose of the password manager is to prevent you from having to enter passwords).
</p><p>In other words:
</p><p>If I enter my master password but leave the computer turned on or my cell phone on the table without closing Firefox (which most people do), then someone can go to my setting and have a plain text version of all my passwords instantly, which is pretty bad. The other thing is that while I understand that SOME people might want to enter their master password once per session, most people don't care about this and find this actually annoying and this should be optional. This is actually beating the purpose of the password manager which is NOT to have to enter any password. They are masked, and I do not care if someone opens my browser and views my facebook. What I really care about however is that they shouldn't be able to go to my settings and have an easy access to all my passwords in plain text!
</p><p>So having to enter your password every session should be an option, while having to enter your password should be mandatory each time you open the password manager itself (or at least optional!). What a major security flaw for a browser that prides itself on privacy...

This is annoying if you want to open more than one page, and must scroll several screenfuls down to reach them. 
</p><p>None of the other sorting methods help either. For example, sort by date just groups the list by date, and sorts alphabetically (!) inside each day. The only chronological sorting method is by last visited, and the position where interesting pages are, is lost every time one is opened.

Is there any specific way for this to work properly in firefox browser? Along with everything else (I wish as a coder) this should be browser independent right?

1209410,1521139994,Mozilla Firefox 57+ : custom toolbar is still supported but how to manage it?,"<p>I have recently migrated all my Firefox profiles to version 58.0.2. 
</p><p>For some profiles, the custom toolbar that I used before FF57+ is now gone. I think this custom toolbar was brought by a legacy extension like Classic Theme Restorer. Since this extension is no more supported in FF57+, the toolbar is gone which is normal. 
But on some profiles, I saw that my custom toolbar was still here (see attached screenshots)
</p><p>My custom toolbar is the one which contains the AdBlock Plus red icon (among others). 
</p><p>This gaves me some hope. This clearly indicates that custom toolbar is still implemented, although we can't create it directly from the GUI.
I checked the browser.uiCustomization.state parameter in about:config.
I saw that my ""__customToolbar_Syl"" custom toolbar was still referenced in the ""placements"" and ""dirtyAreaCache"" sections (which is not the case on the profiles without my custom toolbar).
</p><p>The structure of browser.uiCustomization.state is the following:
{
	""placements"":
	{
		""widget-overflow-fixed-list"":[]
		,""__customToolbar_Syl"":[...] =&gt; my custom toolbar
		,""PersonalToolbar"":[...] =&gt; bookmarks toolbar
		,""nav-bar"":[...] =&gt; toolbar containing the address bar
		,""TabsToolbar"":[...] =&gt; toolbar containing the tabs
		,""toolbar-menubar"":[...] =&gt; top toolbar containing the menus
		,""addon-bar"":[...] =&gt; this is my old toolbar at the bottom (which was used by Download Status Bar (legacy extension)
		,""ctraddon_addon-bar"":[...] =&gt; old toolbar of Classic Theme Restorer extension
		,""ctraddon_extra-bar"":[...] =&gt; old toolbar of Classic Theme Restorer extension
		,""web-developer-toolbar"":[...] =&gt; old toolbar of a dev extension
	}
	,""seen"":[...]
	,""dirtyAreaCache"":[""addon-bar"",""PersonalToolbar"",""nav-bar"",""TabsToolbar"",""toolbar-menubar"",""PanelUI-contents"",""ctraddon_addon-bar"",""web-developer-toolbar"",""ctraddon_extra-bar"",""widget-overflow-fixed-list""]
	,""currentVersion"":13
	,""newElementCount"":1424
}
</p><p>I tried to insert my custom toolbar on another profile (in ""placements"" and ""dirtyAreaCache""), but it never worked. Each time Firefox is restarted, the toolbar is removed from the browser.uiCustomization.state parameter.
I don't understand why on some profiles my custom toolbar is never deleted, and why it is deleted on others.
I hope Firefox will give the ability to create a custom toolbar in next releases. Otherwise, where will we put all the extension's buttons/icons and keep them all visible in the interface (without using the hidden extra list)? For the moment I put them in the menu toolbar, but this is not ideal (on the screenshot you see very few extension's icons as this is a test profile. On my production profiles I have more than 100 extensions...)
</p><p>Mozilla gives absolutely no documentation about this parameter. For instance, I found by myself that I could insert custom separators in the different toolbars using the browser.uiCustomization.state parameter. And this works well.

1209441,1521150196,Why Does My Virtual Keyboard Keeps Retracting When I Tab,"<p>I have a tablet computer that uses a virtual keyboard.   You know, it is an image that pops up when the icon on the task bar is clicked.
Well, in the recent past  it has been acting differently.  I don't know if it is a FireFox problem or a Windows 8.1 problem.  But it is a pain in the butt.
If I want to log on to a site I click in the Username field and tap to bring up the virtual keyboard.
I can then type my username then when I hit Tab the cursor jumps to the password field but the keyboard retracts.
I have to click the icon on the task bar to get the keyboard back.
</p><p>Does anyone know if this is caused by FireFox or do I need to look elsewhere?
Thanks,
Pete

Before I could even read what that is, I accidentally clicked on it because that is where the website I want used to be on my old customized New Tab page. Apparently, that box suggests me to try the new New Tab configuration, and I unluckily for me, clicked yes. 
</p><p>Now everything is different, I tried the method to set browser.newtabpage.activity-stream.aboutHome.enabled browser.newtabpage.activity-stream.enabled to false. That DID NOT WORK. Because that only restores it back to the old New Tab configuration, but not what I customized it to be. I used to have 3 * 4 webpages all pinned in the exactly order so that I could click the website I want even with my eyes closed. Now it becomes a 3*5 configuration, and the order are scrambled completely. The websites appeared in the New Tab now are not the ones I pinned, but only ordered based on the frequency I used them recently. And the some of the websites that appears in this New Tab are not what I want, so I deleted them, but the ones that I want never appear even after it run out of suggestions and become empty dashed squares.
</p><p>Can't you mozilla people be a little less self-centered but more considerate as to what users really need? You designed a new New Tab configuration, so you have to show it off to everyone, huh? Do you really think we old users what your new design? Do you have any idea how much problem it causes and how much it slows the efficiency of my work? And even if you do show off your new design, that's fine if only you just make the browser keep a record of my old customized setting so that I can go back to it easily when I want. But did you?

1209532,1521205899,"Firefox is slower and has less cross integration than chrome, but I still like it better. Can it be faster, more integrated, and better menu system?","<p>I love the layout of firefox. I generally prefer to use it, because it intuitively suites my needs and expectations. While chrome is much faster, and integrates seamlessly with so many accounts, including third party services and sites, it is still much less pleasant to use. Google, like most of the tech world, is obsessed with pushing the 'tech cool' edge, often abandoning very practical systems, in favor of a 'better looking, new shiny' pursuit of so called progress. Apple, and now microsoft does it way worse, with things like auto hiding scrolling bars, and having menu layout make less and less intuitive, practical sense, and basic features just plain not working(My win10 search bar does not work, even after hours of trying fixes, while at the same time, cortana, a search function I never need to use, is a program that is nearly impossible to stop from always running)
This is basically a rant of how computer programming has gone way downhill, and my desire for simple effective design from the days of win98 and winxp. Pocket computers(the phone function is really not even a secondary function, more like one of many applications, and is not even streamlined for regular use) should have buttons, analog control is intuitive, fast, and does not require looking. Remember the days when activating an electronic device meant just feeling for the biggest, easiest to press button? A walkman, or even early mp3 players that had generations old layouts for buttons, so they could be operated with very little thought, and no sight?  Now settings are all stuffed into one or two little icons, which open into large lists of menus, none of which are organized or categorized very well. Each program must be studied and memorized individually, and occasionally continued for new releases and programs, even though they are  not organized in a practical way. It used to be windows, and for example microsoft word, used a common layout, which was mimicked by most other programs, for simplicity and ease of use. Firefox is one of the last examples of a digital service that values user experience over mindless so called progress, but even it has succumbed to the obfuscated menu system, in an attempt to 'keep up' with the rest of the digital environment(so to manually update firefox, I have to click on 3 lines &gt; help &gt; about firefox &gt; update firefox. Really? And why is the Options menu hidden in the 3 line menu? How is zoom, edit, and restore tabs higher on the priority list than the Options? Why not just have a few actual dropdown menus, like old school windows and mac? Was there a problem with such easy to use and organized access to settings etc?
Well this is more than a little OT, but I would really love to hear from anyone about 1. Are these 'progressions of the norm' helpful in some way? and 2. How can we revive the tried and true access methods? Apple has done away with the aux port for their pocket computers, to boost sales of their wireless headphones. We need a strong counter culture that will not take its lead from shameless marketing tactics, and purposeful new obfuscation of access systems that previously worked much better!
I apologize for the long OT rant, but I'm really not sure where to post this, the internet  feels less like a community, and more like a marketing platform, where consumers are tricked and convinced into believing what is good for sales tactics. I tried switching to linux years ago, but it really lacks cross integration, and requires lengthy long term setup and organization time, which used to be just a couple hours customizing a pre win7 OS. Constructive feedback welcome, even if it is contrary to my statements!

</p><p>Today I upgraded Firefox to 59.  When restarting after the upgrade, I lost my session, and ""Restore Previous Session"" was greyed out.  This is the second time this has happened to me -- it happened when Firefox first forced me onto Quantum, and it took me quite a long time to track down what to do to recover my session -- so it was a real bummer that this happened yet again after an upgrade.  Anyway, I did what worked the last time, and what googling this time around seemed to confirm was the thing to do:  after closing Firefox, look in sessionstore-backups, find the jsonlz4 file that seemed appropriate, and copy it into sessionstore.jsonlz4 in the profile directory.  Then, I restarted Firefox.
</p><p>Upon restarting, Firefox hangs almost immediately.  It creates the windows I had open, creates the tabs I had open in each window; but before loading the content of the visible tab, it locks up.  The spinning wheel goes forever; CPU % goes to 100; the memory allocation goes up and up until the system runs out of memory; and nothing in the windows or in the context menu is responsive.  The only thing one can do is kill Firefox from the command line (or, I guess, reboot).  It cannot be closed from within Firefox, as the menus are not responsive.
</p><p>After that kill, Firefox will restart normally, but my old session is again lost and ""Restore Previous Session"" is once again greyed out.  Attempting to recover my old session again causes it to hang immediately upon restart.  Wash, rinse, repeat.
</p><p>Why is Firefox Quantum so unstable with respect to retaining/recovering the previous session?  How can I recover my previous session?
</p><p>Thanks much.

Sad to see this as I have been using FireFox from the very beginning, and of the 15 Browsers I run on this machine, FireFox was in the top 5.
I run 15 different browsers for testing reasons, 10 of them at a time, if I INCLUDE FireFox Browser as one of the 10 that are Running, it brings my powerful system to its knees, and in a matter of hours hangs this powerful system.
Each browser runs with only 2 Tabs open.
Any mix of any 10 of the 15 Browsers WITHOUT FireFox, runs in a stable and speedy manner indefinitely.
</p><p>So Yes, this is clearly to me, a serious memory leak in FireFox Quantum.
</p><p>I am running Adobe Flash in all browsers.  Running on Fedora Linux 26 KDE with the most up to date Adobe Flash 29.0.0.113
On my 2 Windows 10 Laptops, FireFox also bogs the system down.  On Fedora Linux 25 FireFox does the same thing again.
</p><p>I am going to try to revert back to pre-Quantum FireFox, as the older versions worked just fine.
I will check back in a few months to see if Mozilla has figured out this serious memory leak yet.
I am sad for the Mozilla QA team, as this does not look good for them.
Remember to ""eat your own dogfood guys""

Doubtlessly, the Firefox developement team that over see the browser coding project has chosen, wrongly and foolishly, to create an installation scheme that arbitrarilly determines primacy in the Search Engine queue.  With the installation of beta channel version 60.0b4 (64-bit) Quantum I discovered that Yahoo had been REMOVED as my primary search engine and the never to be sufficiently damned Google search engine had been assigned as my Primary. IN FACT, Yahoo had been scrubbed from my system and I had to go out and manually add Yahoo back into the search engine list. I want Mozilla, Google, and the FireFox development teams to know that I have removed Google from my Search Engine queue and have subsequently listed Yahoo as the ONE &amp; ONLY search engine resource. If you want Google to end up owning and controlling Mozilla (maybe they already do!) I will find another Browser (Brave, Blackhawk, or Comodo) and I will take my business elsewhere.

</p><p>The actual question is: what would be the best way to enable vertical tabs without side bar title and without original horizontal tabs remaining in place?
</p><p>Firefox developers, if you are reading this (which I doubt) please don't screw with your user base by Chromefying Firefox. If I wanted a browser like Chrome, I would use Chrome. Give people the power of customization. If the new extension mechanism does not allow customization (eg. only side bar can be used for vertical tabs, not independent area like in the past) , please could you build the feature in the next browser?""

It has problems  quicker when you are on a city that is ready to collect (more animations) and will lock up even if just sitting looking at a city for 5-10 minutes.  Sound/music is off, animations are off, nothing else running but the program on firefox.  Running Windows 10 on an Ideapad 300 with the latest firefox and adobe flash installed.

1209755,1521311956,Recent versions of Firefox not working properly under Linux (Ubuntu 14.04) when $HOME is a NFS mounted file system,"<p>I am managing a group of network booted Ubuntu 14.04 workstations at a small town (public) library and the current version of Firefox for Ubuntu 14.04 crashes.  The machine have all of the file systems NFS mounted.  Installing an older version (Firefox 52.6.0 ESR) works however.  The new version of Firefox works just fine on the pair library owned laptops, that also run Ubuntu 14.04, but the laptops are self-contained -- they boot off their local disks.   Why is this?  I have pretty much determined that the only definable issue is that the network booted machines are using NFS for their file systems.  No, the workstations are not sharing logins -- each machine auto-logins to a *different* user, each with their own *separate* $HOME directory and they are *not* trying to share firefox configuration trees ($HOME/.mozilla/firefox/...).  But all of these directories are NFS mounted.  Oh, the server for the /home file system is running CentOS 6.

1209764,1521314390,Please help me get new Firefox and not the one stored by my cyber-terrorist.,"<p>My former partner of 10 years was/is a computer guru/hacker and not in a good way. I am a girl who could barely copy and paste when we met. Little did I know, that for the past decade my reality has been controlled by this man. When I finally gathered the strength to end this horrifically abusive relationship he waged a war upon me, that I wouldn't wish upon anyone.  
Since October he has hacked every account I have, disabled my phones, put Activtrak-ing on me. Took over my Google account and my Microsoft account, my one drive, i Cloud, Gmail and drive and has systematically deleted my history and actually altered my geographical locations. He somehow became a supervisor on my accounts by becoming my purchase payee and has used my accounts for nefarious purposes. Turns out this man is an actual psychopath. Not the serial killer kind but a 36 out of 40 on the Hare Psychopathic test. 
I obtained a restraining order to stop him but it's only upped his game and set him on a path of determination of destroying me in every way imaginable.
He has his own operating system on all of my computers and it is impossible to get rid of. I bought a brand new computer and he broke into my house and put a smartcard into it which turned it into his own personally engineered operating system..like all the rest. Wait, It gets even better,  While he was here he turned my private network into his own domain. Just another layer in his dominance and control over me and my life. My search engines are his. I've tried refreshing Mozilla a hundred times and it remains the same. Same for Internet Explorer and Google Chrome. He won't let them update and there are lists a mile long of websites that I am not allowed to go to. I get 404 errors if I try.  I've tried everything, including hiring computer repair people to no avail. Even Microsoft couldn't help me because he is in my phone as well as has a block on either of us being able to contact the other.
You're probably saying ""have him arrested"" which I have but he just bails out of jail and continues his destructive manifesto.
I am at my wits end. I've been so traumatized by all of this that I've literally needed to see a doctor who prescribed me xanax just to try to cope. This man controlled me and my life for 10 years and he did things to me that were unforgivable but this..This is a nightmare that has consumed me since October. I was lucky to escape the relationship alive , all things considered.
There has to be someone out there that can HELP ME. So far, no one has been able to put a stop to this. Please, I deserve to have some semblance of a life and I never will as long as he is controlling everything. I can't take much more. I feel violated every minute of the day and night. He watches and records me through Windows Media Player. I've discovered so much over the course of these past 4 1/2 months. Things I never wanted to know. However, barring my complete isolation into a cabin ""Ted Kazinsky"" style, I need this to stop while I'm still somewhat sane. Please. I'm a good girl who hasn't deserved any of this. Please help me get my life back.    lisa

There are already very accessible main menus on the Mac so no need to put a hamburger menu in the browser window with a different organization.  It's just confusing.

I wish FF would research in Safari's open source how they manage threads for web content when nobody is viewing it (hidden tab or whole app hidden) and implement the same.  Hint - they probably suspend their execution.  :-)

</p><p>Also I would like to add Firefox crashes when I start it up it gives me the crash report window and I just press restart firefox and it works normally again till I close it down or start it up....so yah

1209873,1521381440,"Firefox freezes when using touch screen, gets back to normal after moving physical mouse or pressing any key on physical keyboard","<p>Lenovo Yoga 2 10 Tablet (1051f) - Bad performance when using touch screen, good performance when using mouse+keyboard
</p><p>MAIN ISSUE:
When using touch display as input method, the performance in Firefox (59.0.1) is very bad - there are multiple freezes and various other issues. 
The issues go away when using an external mouse+keyboard via USB.
</p><p>FURTHER DETAILS:
The most frustrating issues appear when:
-switching between various open tabs in FF
-closing and opening new tabs
-right clicking on a tab &gt; selecting ""pin tab"" - instead of pinning the tab, FF opens the website in a new window - it can be then dragged-into the original FF window, and pinned without problem
-The general performance seems very bad and not what you would expect it to be
</p><p>WHAT HELPS:
-Connecting a mouse+keyboard through USB - then the performance is what I would expect from this hardware
</p><p>VIDEOS SHOWING THE ISSUE:
1) Recording showing bad performance when using touch input:
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq1QYrXUlYE"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq1QYrXUlYE</a>
Note how clicking on the ""multitasking"" button at the bottom of the screen (I don't know the real name) interrupts the freeze, and then performance is back to normal... for some time.
</p><p>2) Freeze when using touch input:
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4csda5Kdl0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4csda5Kdl0</a>
What this video is showing:
-touching the display - everything is frozen, tablet does not react to touches
-then the physical mouse is moved (just moved! no clicking!)
-you can then see sudden ""update"" of what was done using touch input, and everything returns to normal
</p><p>3) Another instance of the same thing as in point 2:
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cHMTv0A2gE"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cHMTv0A2gE</a>

It rendered on top of my taskbar, I tried to fix it by maximizing the Firefox window again but it did not work. Then I set the scaling back to 100%, now it will not load at all. It does launch, I can see processes with task manager but will not load. I can get it to load only if I launch Firefox at 100% then switch to 125%, even then it won't render correctly. I get weird white bars and window draws over taskbar. I'll try to replicate the bug and get a full window screenshot. Thing I have tried so far are:
</p><p>-Deleting  xulstore.json and local(forgot the name)
-Deleting profiles completely
-Uninstalling Firefox, deleting all left over files, using Bleachbit to delete cache etc. then reinstalling.
-Enabling/Disabling Hardware Acceleration settings
-Safe mode
-Removing extensions
-Assigning Firefox rendering to either CPU's graphics core and GPU.
-And few more things that I cannot remember now.
</p><p>This was a fresh Windows 10 install, I have no antivirus or any other software installed that might interfere with Firefox.
</p><p>I have another PC with working Firefox, I will now try copying Firefox's files from that PC to this one but I do not think that will work, this is my last resort.
</p><p>Edit: Copying working Firefox files from another computer did not work.
</p><p>Edit 2: I found what caused the issue. I was using coloured title bars across Windows, unticking the ""Show accent color on title bars"" option on Windows 10 settings did the trick.
</p><p>Edit 3: Also found out that unticking the ""Title Bar"" setting from Firefox's customization menu fixes the issue. So, a combination the combination of setting custom title bar colors and merging the title bar with tabs caused the issue. Though, it still baffles me because this combination did work fine before and it still works fine on my desktop PC. I still believe scaling did the triggering.

</p><p>The other newly interesting aspect to Firefox Quantum is that there is no longer a “download” indicator, which is not a big deal to me as I found it to be somewhat annoying to constantly need to clear.

If they don't change when I reload, they are usually fine, but when they were just opened last session they are at risk of being changed. The tab's site icon usually remains, but the name of the tab changes to say what it will load as, which is how I can tell something has gone wrong before I click it. The wrongly loaded tabs also come with history, implying they are closed tabs from before, and have been wrongly stocked as ""saved tabs"" and are overwriting the tabs that should have been saved. Any idea how to change this so it saves the proper tabs and what i have open remains when i reload the browser?

1210004,1521459822,Is it possible to sync Firefox settings such as Search options?,"<p>I've just decided to switch to Firefox from Chrome, and have made an account to use Firefox sync. However, I noticed that after syncing, I don't have some of my search shortcuts that are listed in the ""One-click search engines"" section in Settings &gt; Search. This means that I don't have some of my search shortcuts, and have to set them up again manually, which is a little bit annoying. I do, however, have search shortcuts that were made by right clicking on search boxes and added via the bookmark system. Is there any way to sync search settings too?
</p><p>I did find another question on this topic, but it was from 2016, so I wondered if the answer to the original question (there is no way to sync search settings, but it might get added) had changed in the past couple of years, and if not, are there plans to add the option to sync settings.

1210032,1521474765,"Browser completely black only on one screen, triggered by maximizing the browser window.","<p>I have only been able to reproduce this on one screen. The screen is connected to a NVIDIA Quadro M1000M, with up to date drivers (v23.21.13.9103). The display that shows the problem is connected via DisplayPort to HDMI. The display not having issues is connected via DVI (using the internal Intel HD Graphics 530).
</p><p>I can reproduce this in both Firefox and Firefox Developer edition, both fresh installs with no plugins added.
</p><p>The way to repro is to maximize the browser on the screen with no issue, and witness no issue. Then drag the browser to the other screen and maximize the browser. What I see is intermittent behavior, but happens within the first 3-5 attempts to maximize.
Maximizing on the other screen (which is using the internal Intel HD Graphics 530) shows no issue (fixes it again).
</p><p>You MUST maximize the browser on the 'working screen' first for this to occur.
</p><p>For example, if I follow these steps exactly, I can reproduce the problem:
</p><p>1. Start browser
</p><p>2. Drag browser window to 'working screen' (the never having problems screen)
</p><p>3. Maximize the window.
</p><p>4. Drag the window to the 'non-working screen' (meaning the one where everything else is perfectly fine except for firefox)
</p><p>5. Maximize the window. (It will go completely black.)
</p><p><br>
6. To undo, drag the browser window back to the working screen, let go.
</p><p>7. Drag the browser window back to the non-working screen, let go.
</p><p>8. As long as you do not maximize it, it works fine.
</p><p><br>
Interestingly enough, I cannot reproduce the problem while running either browsers in safe mode, but as I've said, these are fresh installs with no custom configuration or tools installed.
</p><p>As you can see in my attached screenshot, this is a screen capture of the browser sitting between both monitors, black on one side and normal on the other.
If the browser is not maximized, it works flawlessly on both screens. As soon as you maximize it, it goes black and remains black until you drag it onto the other screen, let go, then drag it back.
</p><p>Good luck with that! It's pretty crazy.

</p><p>Since a few days I have a frustrating problem with Firefox. It is version 59.0.1 64-bit on Windows 7.
</p><p>What happens is that sometimes, once in a while, the content would hide itself from view. you can ""blind"" copy&amp;paste the text and paste it into notepad and you see the text there. The content can be anything, text, links, pictures etc. And it is not static, if you move your mouse pointer it may show or hide itself. mostly pictures. Text tend to stay hidden. 
</p><p>What I have done:
Run in safe mode,
Done complete uninstall including user files and reinstalled same version. 
</p><p>Problem reappears but it is also so annoying as it might look good for 1 hour and then suddenly it got glitchy AGAIN.
</p><p>I have also shut down everything in Windows but the very essentials.
</p><p>I do not know what caused it. If it is new Firefox being not very compatible with my setup or if it could have been the malware attack I got 1 week ago. I ran Malwarebyte and one other software to purge it. No new hits, running scans all the time.

1210068,1521488141,Weird Content Problem with Firefox--CreateSpace,"<p>I've been using firefox for years since IE 10 doesn't work with Vista and haven't had too many problems other than versions higher than 42.0 being very slow to start (over ten seconds), so I try to use the lowest version I could. I used 38.0.1 with my problem which was with createspace on Amazon using their cover creator to create a cover for my self-published book. Two weeks went by and nobody could figure out why the cover creator program would hang on ""update"" with the circle in the middle. Nobody at Amazon, nobody at CreateSpace--in fact, they all reported they could access my cover just fine. So I cleared my cache and history, uninstalled Firefox back to 38.0.1 and even I tried version 52.0 and still, whenever I would launch the cover creator program within Amazon's Kindle Direct Publishing, I could not access my cover and the system would hang indefinitely on ""updating"" and ""loading designs"". 
</p><p>So after two weeks, the thought came to me to try a different browser. Having limited choices for Vista SP-2, I downloaded Chrome 49.0.2623.112 and went back into the KDP cover creator and boom! No problems. I was able to update my cover with Chrome and get my book published because the stumbling block was Firefox. I tried IE 9.0 but of course, I got a notice by Amazon that said my browser was not supported and was stopped at the front door. The outcome was Chrome was able to do things that Firefox could not, and nobody was ever able to tell me why. Why did the cover creator program, neither a Java applet nor a flash program, would hang for hours on ""loading designs"" even after a fresh start and a clean cache.
</p><p>As a result, Firefox is off my system and I am still using Chrome with no problems. In fact, I want to keep it because it loads in like two seconds, shuts down in two seconds instead of ten, and browsing is much, much faster. The conclusion I have come to is that Chrome, although no longer supported, is superior to Firefox with the Vista operating system. I only have one plug-in and that is an ad blocker (ADP).
</p><p>Thoughts? I really wanted to stay with Firefox, but in this case, I had no choice because a book project I had worked on for 22 years was held up at the one-yard line by Firefox. The same problem was non-existent with Chrome. So I came to the conclusion that Chrome is better for Vista than Firefox (restatement of the same thing).

</p><p>Here's the specific add-on I'm talking about, there's several different addons that people came out with in the past few weeks to deal with this change in Google Images. Mine worked for a while, then it stopped, I tried a different addon (meaning this one), now that's not working either.

Last installed apps, according to my control panel:

[other stuff 4 day ago]
</p><p>Until the day before yesterday, all was working fine. Yesterday, I didn't try to access my websites. And today I have now spent the entire day trying to access them again.
</p><p>Now. Windows ""No Actions Needed"" Defender, says 0 threats in my 327395 files. HiJackThis substantially agrees.
Malawarebytes and AdAware quarantined and removed some stuff: Pokki, Lenovo Browser Guard(sic!), and Browser Guard, a very German browser extension I can't remember to have ever listen about neither I can figure out why I should ever had desired to install. 
SpyBotSearch and Destroy destroyed a bunch of terrifying tracking cookies and remembered me that I have also an Internet Explorer. While RKill killed a vagrant-box process and remembered me that I have 42 HOSTS Entries - always good to know!
</p><p>Malawarebytes also blocked about 30 outbound connections in series of 3-5 each one, to three very interesting websites:
</p><pre>- <a href=""http://coinhive.com"" rel=""nofollow"">coinhive.com</a> and its wonderful world of bitcoinish subdomains, from C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe,
- <a href=""http://sp-alive-msg.conduit-data.com"" rel=""nofollow"">sp-alive-msg.conduit-data.com</a> from  C:\PROGRA~2\LENOVO~1\LenovoBrowserGuard\bin\cltmng.exe,
- <a href=""http://www.1-1ads.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.1-1ads.com</a>, from C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe.
</pre>
<p>(OOT: If you do like subdomains, IPs and their ports, you can found every dirty detail in the attached file. Did you hear Google? <a href=""http://coinhive.com"" rel=""nofollow"">coinhive.com</a> subdomains and IP addresses and ports, <a href=""http://coinhive.com"" rel=""nofollow"">coinhive.com</a> !!)
</p><p>The problem appears also on Google Chrome. I tried to import the certificate of one of my local sites in the Trusted Root Certification Authorities, cause Chrome was saying that this was the problem: useless. The certificate is ""OK"" but the connection is not private.
</p><p>No success also with a fresh Portable Firefox installation. While with Edge: ""Hmmm...can’t reach this page. There was a temporary DNS error. Error Code: INET_E_RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND"". ( But I cannot really affirm that with Edge all was fine until today.)
</p><p>Now, if the answer to the present support request will be: remove your malaware, man!, my request is: why I cannot simply order to my browser, to skip the security connection check? Why should browsers disallow the access to a website bad-encrypted if you order it to access it anyway? If I know that it is badly encrypted, I understand it's maybe not encrypted; but I can access every website not encrypted at all. So what's the problem?

1210123,1521524814,When ver 59.01/64 opens it takes about 45 seconds + to load first tab.,"<p>Have tried the following to no avail:  Safe Mode - Disabling all Add-Ons - Clearing Cache - Clearing Cookies - Disabling automatic updates - Refresh...  I have also noticed that I have 5 instances of Firefox.exe running in task manager but none are using any excessive CPU time.  If Firefox is started and allowed to sit idle for 45 to 60 seconds then the first load of the first tab takes place at a normal speed for this version of Firefox.  Immediately loading a website after Firefox startup results in a 45 to 60 second wait.  I have perused the Task Manager looking at processes from all users and can find none using any excessive CPU time.  No network activity during this time except an initial ""blip"" when I first initiate the search.  Secure websites could be part of the problem since i noticed that less secure sites load a bit faster although not at the rate they do after the first 45 or 50 seconds.  I almost forgot.  I am running Windows 7 Ultimate.  Any ideas?
